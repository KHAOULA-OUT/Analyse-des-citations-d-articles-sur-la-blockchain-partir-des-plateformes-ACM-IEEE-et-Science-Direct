However, malicious or lazy devices may migrate the fake models or resist sharing models for their benefit, reducing the desired efficiency and reliability of a federated learning system. To this end, this work presents a blockchain-based model migration approach for resource-constrained IoT systems. The proposed approach aims to achieve secure model migration and speed up model training while minimizing computation cost. We first develop an incentive mechanism considering the economic benefits of fast devices, which breaks the Nash equilibrium established by lazy devices and encourages capable devices to train and share models. Second, we design a clustering-based algorithm for identifying malicious devices and preventing them from defrauding incentives. Third, we use blockchain to ensure trustworthiness in model migration and incentive processes. Blockchain records the interaction between the central server and IoT devices and runs the incentive algorithm without exposing the devices’ private data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed approach can accelerate federated learning rates, reduce model training computation costs to increase sustainability, and resist malicious attacks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3171926","Natural Science Foundation ofHunan Province(grant numbers:2021JJ40122); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:No. 62002113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766205","Blockchain;federated learning;sustainable computing;IoT;training acceleration;security.","Collaborative work;Training;Blockchains;Computational modeling;Data models;Servers;Costs","","","","","","","IEEE","2 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to restricted resources, vehicles must share observed data with RSUs and other vehicles to execute some time-tolerant computing tasks. However, data provided by vehicles cannot always be trusted due to the presence of attackers. Fake messages could have catastrophic ramifications, such as vehicle collisions. Furthermore, extensive data sharing might cause channel congestion, resulting in the loss of vital messages during delivery. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we propose TRUCON, a blockchain-based trusted data sharing mechanism with congestion control in IoV. Firstly, we propose a Kademlia algorithm-based traffic data forwarding method to control channel congestion state. By adjusting the bucket size and distance threshold, source vehicles can limit the number of reference vehicles forwarded. Secondly, we present a cuckoo filter-based traffic data deduplication and discrimination approach. To avoid repetitive sharing, vehicles and RSUs can check their local filters to verify if the current data report has been shared. Based on the foregoing, we propose a blockchain-based trust management mechanism with congestion control. RSUs serve as full nodes while vehicles are light nodes in the blockchain. Finally, we develop a trust management prototype system with congestion control that incorporates both on-chain and off-chain parts. It signifies that our scheme is both feasible and effective.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3226500","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272154,62002113); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2021JJ40122); Open Project Program of Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Cyberspace Government of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:202110138); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989338","Internet of Vehicles;blockchain;trust management;data sharing;congestion control","Blockchains;Trust management;Electronic mail;Computer science;Internet of Vehicles;Roads;Accidents","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To address the issue that malicious users cannot be locked in the fully anonymous sharing schemes, we propose a trackable anonymous remote healthcare data storing and sharing scheme over decentralized consortium blockchain. Through an “on-chain & off-chain” model, it relieves the massive data storage pressure of medical blockchain. By introducing an improved proxy re-encryption mechanism, the proposed scheme realizes the fine-gained access control of the outsourced data, and can also prevent the collusion between semi-trusted cloud servers and data requestors who try to reveal EMRs without authorization. Compared with the existing schemes, our solution can provide a lower computational overhead in repeated EMRs sharing, resulting in a more efficient overall performance.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2022.3183397","Key Industry Innovation Chain Project of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2020ZDLGY05-04,2021ZDLGY05-03); Taif University Researchers Supporting Project of Taif(grant numbers:TURSP-2020/126); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)(grant numbers:JP18K18044,JP21K17736); Hubei Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021CFB156); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797064","Remote medical data sharing;privacy preservation;blockchain;proxy re-encryption","Medical services;Blockchains;Data privacy;Servers;Security;Cloud computing;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Besides, in order to efficiently search communication logs and not reveal any sensitive information of communication data, we design a secure search scheme over such blockchain database, the asymmetric scalar-product preserving encryption (ASPE) approach is exploited to guarantee the data security, and the two layers index improves the search efficiency.

We argue that the critical nature of logs calls for immutability and verification mechanism without a single trusted party. This paper proposes such a mechanism by describing a blockchain-based log system, called Logchain, which integrates with existing private and public blockchain solutions. Logchain uses the immutability of blockchain to provide a tamper-resistance platform for log storage. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical structure to address blockchains' scalability issues. To validate the mechanism, we integrate Logchain into Ethereum and IBM Blockchain. We assess the solution's scalability and analyze the cost of ownership, helping readers select a feasible solution.

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain adopts a graph structure of a single transaction as the basic unit, and it has the characteristics of asynchronous consensus. Some existing studies use DAGblockchain to replace the traditional blockchain to alleviate its low throughput problems like IOTA. However, with the rapid data generation in the IIoT environment, the topology scale of DAG-blockchain will increase sharply, which will aggravate the data storage cost of blockchain nodes. In this article, to reduce the data storage cost of edge servers, we design a Graphpartition based storage strategy for DAG-Blockchain (GpDB), equipped with a graph partition algorithm based on transaction freshness, which can partition DAG-blockchain topology in edge servers into two parts, which will be retained and removed respectively.

To facilitate the widespread application of MCS, we propose a novel MCS learning framework leveraging on blockchain technology and the new concept of edge intelligence based on federated learning (FL), which involves four major entities, including requestors, blockchain, edge servers and mobile devices as workers. Even though there exist several studies on blockchain-based MCS and blockchain-based FL, they cannot solve the essential challenges of MCS with respect to accommodating resource-constrained requestors or deal with the privacy concerns brought by the involvement of requestors and workers in the learning process. To fill the gaps, four main procedures, i.e., task publication, data sensing and submission, learning to return final results, and payment settlement and allocation, are designed to address major challenges brought by both internal and external threats, such as malicious edge servers and dishonest requestors. Specifically, a mechanism design based data submission rule is proposed to guarantee the data privacy of mobile devices being truthfully preserved at edge servers; consortium blockchain based FL is elaborated to secure the distributed learning process; and a cooperation-enforcing control strategy is devised to elicit full payment from the requestor.

It gains scalability by adopting a hierarchy of multiple blockchains that processes transactions in parallel. We design an ID-based dual-balance account model where an identity-based account is associated with two types of balancesa plaintext balance and a private (zero-knowledge) balance. Furthermore, we design a two-phase cross-chain transaction mechanism (2PXT) to achieve transaction privacy for both intra-chain and cross-chain transactions. We rigorously formulate a security model for HyperMaze under the universal composability framework, and then provide a simulation-based security proof. A prototype of HyperMaze is implemented and a series of experiments are conducted over up to 2,600 nodes to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that a 4-level, (7,10)-threshold, 6-ary HyperMaze system can reach 19,440 TPS and the transaction confirmation latency is only 9.5 seconds.

However, the mining process requires high computational power, which prevents IoT devices from directly participating in blockchain construction. For this reason, edge computing service is introduced to help build the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational resources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT devices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data analysis and data storage. In this scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase different resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be maximized. Moreover, edge servers will set ""best"" prices such that they can get the biggest benefits.

Recently, permissioned blockchains garner particular attention thanks to their improved scalability and diverse needs from different organizations. One representative example of permissioned blockchain is Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric). Due to its unique execute-order procedure, there is a critical need for a client to select an optimal number of peers. The interesting problem that this paper targets to address is the tradeoff in the number of peers: a too large number will degrade scalability while a too small number will make the network vulnerable to faulty nodes. This optimization issue gets especially challenging in V2X networks due to mobility of nodes: a transaction must be executed, and the associated block must be committed before the vehicle leaves a network. To this end, this paper proposes a mechanism for selecting an optimal set of peers based on reinforcement learning (RL) to keep a Fabric-empowered V2X network impervious to dynamicity due to mobility. We model the RL as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed scheme.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2022.3168575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760010","Connected Vehicles;Blockchain;Hyperledger Fabric;BFT;RL;MAB","Fabrics;Peer-to-peer computing;Blockchains;Vehicle-to-everything;Organizations;Scalability;Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, conventional centralized architecture of such dynamic IoT spectrum sharing systems is often considered to be non-transparent, costly, and vulnerable to potential attacks and single-point failures. To address the aforementioned issues, a blockchain-based dynamic spectrum sharing scheme has been proposed and investigated in this work, which aims at enhancing the system by providing desirable features such as decentralization, transparency, immutability, and auditability. By considering the privacy and transaction dynamics issues when blockchain is integrated into spectrum sharing systems, a privacy-preserving double auction mechanism based on differential privacy is developed for incentivizing spectrum sharing, where the time-varying valuations of the spectrum resources are also taken into consideration. In the proposed auction, a winner determination problem (WDP) is formulated to decide the winning bidders and spectrum allocation. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method is then proposed for efficiently solving the WDP. The proposed auction mechanism can be integrated with smart contracts on blockchain platforms. Furthermore, the computation of the DRL-based method for solving the WDP is designed as part of the consensus mechanism in the blockchain. Theoretical analysis show that the proposed privacy-aware double auction mechanism satisfies the properties of differential privacy, individual rationality, and truthfulness.

In this paper, we explore how blockchain techniques can help us achieve a verifiable and forward-privacy DSSE scheme. Our scheme resorts to the emerging smart contract as a trusted platform to store digests for public result verification, and carefully crafts dynamic query protocols to enable encrypted search with forward-privacy. In our design, indexes are collocated with encrypted files and stored at storage-servers, which makes the blockchain light-weighted and search operations more efficient. Moreover, we propose a hybrid index design to support efficient files deletion. By using our blockchain-assisted primitive, the property collision between dynamic result verification and forward-privacy can be solved.

BRA holds truthfulness and individual rationality, which can ensure the sellers to report costs honestly and prevent sellers to manipulate the auction. Moreover, we implement a Secure Truth Discovery and reliability Rating (STDR) mechanism in BCDToken based on homomorphic cryptography, which can incentivize sellers to upload the truthful data and consumers to rate truthfully the reliabilities of sellers without revealing any privacy of data. Additionally, we also deploy BCDToken to the test network to demonstrate its practicability.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3107187","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61379132,61572336,61572457,61632016,61872330,62172386,U1709217); Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies(grant numbers:AHY150300); Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution(grant numbers:18KJA520010); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK2009150,BK20131174,BK20191194); the National Key RD Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521727","Blockchain;Crowdsourcing;Data trading;Mobile crowdsensing;Privacy;Reverse auction;Truth discovery","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Reliability;Encryption;Mobile computing;Data models;Data collection","","","","1","","","IEEE","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The users can rest assured that the computations from the clouds are correct with the audit mechanism of the proposed scheme.

Breaching data or forging source devices after injecting advanced persistent threats (APT) damages the industry owners’ money and loss of operators’ lives. The existing challenges include APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. Edgeservers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which in essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers while transporting data using traditional PKI-rendered trusts, consortium blockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning, edge devices can filter malicious data at their end which largely motivates us to institute a Blockchain and AI aligned APT detection system. The unique contributions of the paper include efficient APT detection at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boost trust among collaborators and ensure an economical and sustainable mechanism after eliminating existing certificate authority.

HIBEChain consists of multiple permissioned blockchains that form a hierarchical tree structure. To support the hierarchical structure of HIBEChain, we design a decentralized hierarchical identity-based signature (DHIBS) scheme, which enables IoT devices to use their identities as public keys. Consequently, HIBEChain achieves high scalability through parallel processing as blockchain sharding schemes, and it also implements accountability by use of identity-base keys. Identity-based keys not only make HIBEChain more user-friendly, they also allow private key recovery by validators when necessary.

Nevertheless, the increasingly heavy storage consumption brought by the full-replication data storage mechanism, becomes a bottleneck to the system scalability. To address this problem, a reliable storage scheme named BFT-Store, integrating erasure coding with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), was proposed recently. While, three critical problems are still left open: (i) The complex re-initialization process of the blockchain when the number of nodes varies; (ii) The high computational overload of downloading data; (iii) The massive communication on the network. This paper proposes a blockchain storage scheme termed PartitionChain which addresses the above three problems, maintaining the merits of BFT-Store. Firstly, our scheme allows the original nodes to merely update a single aggregate signature in the re-initialization. Secondly, the computational complexity of retrieving data by decoding is greatly reduced. Thirdly, the amount of transmitted data for recovering data is reduced from O(n) (assuming n is the number of nodes) to O(1). Furthermore, this paper introduces a reputation ranking system where the malicious behaviors of the nodes can be detected, enabling PartitionChain to expel the nodes with misbehavior to the specific extent.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3136556","Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:2021-01-07-00-08-E00101); NSFC-ISF Joint Scientific Research Program(grant numbers:61961146004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656652","Blockchain Storage;Reed-Solomon Coding;Byzantine Fault Tolerance;System Scalability;Dynamic Network","Blockchains;Encoding;Peer-to-peer computing;Decoding;Computational complexity;Aggregates;Scalability","","","","","","","CCBY","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These attacks have one common cause: block withholding. This paper proposes Crystal, which leverages quorum certificates to resist block withholding misbehavior. Crystal continuously elects committees from miners and requires each block to have a quorum certificate, i.e., a set of signatures issued by members of its committee. Consequently, an attacker has to publish its blocks to obtain quorum certificates, rendering block withholding impossible. To build Crystal, we design a novel two-round committee election in a Sybil-resistant, unpredictable and non-interactive way, and a reward mechanism to incentivize miners to follow the protocol. Our analysis and evaluations show that Crystal can significantly mitigate selfish mining and double-spending attacks. For example, in Bitcoin, an attacker with 30% of the total computation power will succeed in double-spending attacks with a probability of 15.6% to break the 6-confirmation rule; however, in Crystal, the success probability for the same attacker falls to 0.62%. We provide formal end-to-end safety proofs for Crystal, ensuring no unknown attacks will be introduced. To the best of our knowledge, Crystal is the first protocol that prevents selfish mining and double-spending attacks while providing safety proof.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3216749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927474","Blockchains;Nakamoto Consensus;Withholding attack;Selfish mining;double-spending;Quorum certificate","Crystals;Protocols;Bitcoin;Safety;Resists;Blockchains;Voting","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Existing blockchain-based computation offloading schemes usually focus on network performance improvements, such as energy consumption minimization or latency minimization, and neglect the Gas fee for computation offloading, resulting in the dissatisfaction of high Gas providers. Also, the secrecy rate during the data uploading process can not be measured by a steady value because of the time-varying characteristics of IRS-based wireless channels, thereby computational resources allocation with a secrecy rate measured before data uploading is inappropriate. In this paper, we design a Gas-oriented computation offloading scheme that guarantees a low degree of dissatisfaction of sensors, while reducing energy consumption. Also, we deduce the ergodic secrecy rate of IRS-assisted PLS transmission that can represent the global secrecy performance to allocate computational resources. The simulations show that the proposed scheme has lower energy consumption compared to existing schemes, and ensures that the node paying higher Gas gets stronger computational resources.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3159248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733890","Internet of Things;blockchain;physical layer security;intelligent reflecting surface;Gas-oriented.","Task analysis;Sensors;Internet of Things;Servers;Blockchains;Resource management;Security","","","","5","","","IEEE","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In sustainable computing networks, with the increasing scale of data-driven applications, massive privacy-sensitive data are generated. How to effectively process such data on resource-limited IoT devices is challenging. Although edge intelligence (EI) is designed to maintain an appropriate level of ultradelay reliability, low latency communication (URLLC), real-time data processing, and security and privacy are concerning. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-supported hierarchical digital twin IoT (HDTIoT) framework, which combines the digital twin to edge network and adopts blockchain technology to achieve secure and reliable real-time computation. We first propose a data and knowledge dual-driven learning solution to ensure real-time interaction and efficient optimization between the physical and the digital worlds. To improve communication and computation efficiency with data and knowledge dual-driven learning, the optimization goal is to minimize the system delay and energy consumption and ensure system reliability and the learning accuracy of IoT devices. Moreover, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem. Experimental results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme can improve the efficiency of the HDTIoT system, guarantee learning accuracy, reliability and security, and make a balance between system delay and energy consumption.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3162714","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:Nos.61772387, 62071354); the ISN State Key Laboratory; the National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:Grant No. 2019ZDLGY03-03); Open Research Projects of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:No. 2019KD0AD01/013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750989","data and knowledge;blockchain;resource management;reinforcement learning;sustainable computing.","Servers;Resource management;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Reliability;Optimization;Digital twin","","","","1","","","IEEE","6 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It builds a secure and robust system by generating a backup locally for each participant node to collectively maintain the network. However, this feature brings some privacy concerns since all nodes can access the chain data, users' sensitive information under risk of leakage. The local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism can be a promising way to address this issue as it implements data perturbation before uploading to the chain. While traditional LDP mechanisms cannot fit well with blockchain since the requirements of a fixed input range, large data volume, and using the same privacy budget, which are practically difficult in a decentralized environment. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel LDP mechanism to split input numerical data and implement perturbation by digital bits, which does not require a fixed input range and large data volume. In addition, we use an iteration approach to adaptively allocate the privacy budget for different perturbation procedures that minimize the total deviation of perturbed data and increase the data utility. We employ mean estimation as the statistical utility metric under the same and randomized privacy budgets to evaluate the performance of our novel LDP mechanism. The experiment results indicate that the proposed LDP mechanism performs better in different scenarios, and our adaptive privacy budget allocation model can significantly reduce the deviation of perturbation function to provide high data utility while maintaining privacy.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3145845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691277","Local differential privacy;numerical splitting;adaptive privacy budget allocation;mean estimation;blockchain","Blockchains;Perturbation methods;Privacy;Internet of Things;Estimation;Encoding;Servers","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This integration with end users produces large-scale and heterogeneous data sources that demand machine learning (ML)-based data analytics for decision-making and to provide security against ML and data privacy attacks. The development of privacy-aware ML models within a federated learning (FL) ecosystem can empower an entire network to learn from data in a decentralized manner. In this article, we propose a differentially privacy blockchain-based explainable FL (DP-BFL) framework by harnessing the ever-evolving power of SM 3.0 networks. This framework permits any Internet empowered device to partake and contribute data to a global privacy preserved model. In this framework, participants will upload the differentially private local updates to the miners of blockchain, where the local updates will be evaluated and rewarded. The experimental results obtained from real-world datasets, namely, SM 3.0 and MNIST, demonstrated that the proposed framework could achieve high utility, enhanced privacy, and elevated efficiency. More Specifically, the experimental analysis of our proposed framework reveals the following two key properties. First, our proposed DP-BFL yields noticeable performance improvements in the applied learning models with high privacy and comparable utility levels, in terms of accuracy and f-measure metrics, to a standard FL and centralized learning approaches under the restriction of privacy preservation. Second, given a certain number of the malicious entities, DP-BFL allowed an enhanced recognition of users' preferences in the SM 3.0 dataset and precise prediction of images' class in the MNIST dataset while mitigating the impact of the malicious entities' poisoned updates.

However, high-fidelity models of digital twins raise the requirement of efficient data flows, which is limited by realistic constraints such as data collection strategy and energy supply. We propose a sustainable data collection and management approach to construct digital twins for physical assets. With this approach, data packets are uploaded to the data brokers, namely agents, by a large number of IoT devices. The challenge lies in the balance between enduring data collection and the information loss associated with the stale data. In this article, we aim to optimize the metrics of data fidelity and reveal delay while guaranteeing both sustainable energy and sustainable information. Additionally, a shareable and sustainable blockchain-based digital twin management architecture is proposed, which does not rely on data exchanges with a single centralized server.

Blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (BCPPA) is proposed to achieve an optimal tradeoff among anonymity, traceability and key/certificate management in VANETs. Existing BCPPA protocols mitigate these security and privacy challenges by adding a significant cost on verification and traceability. As a result, current solutions fail to meet high mobility, low latency, and real-time requirements of VANETs. In this paper, we design three new system building blocks namely key derivation (KeyDer), signatures of knowledge (SoK) and smart contract, following by a more efficient BCPPA protocol (named as EBCPA). To show the advantage of EBCPA, we first demonstrate it can satisfy the necessary requirements (e.g. message authentication, conditional privacy protection, resilience to common attacks, and so forth). Moreover, we implement the EBCPA in the on-line Ethereum test network (Rinkeby), Hyperledger test network and VANETs simulation environment (via VanetMobiSim and NS-2). Finally, we evaluate its communication overhead and computational cost via comparing to existing BCPPA protocols that strive to achieve similar properties. From the implementation and comparison results, our proposal can improve efficiency by reducing the time cost of traceability at least 48.95% and verification at least 42.21%.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3164740","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA1000600); Science Foundation of Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Agency(grant numbers:2020J02016); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032005, 62102089, U21A20466, 61972094, 61972294); Special Project on Science and Technology Program of Hubei Provience(grant numbers:2020AEA013); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042021kf1030); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020CFA052); Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2020010601012187); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9749919","Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs);Conditional Privacy-preserving Authentication (CPPA);Blockchain;Signatures of Knowledge;Key Derivation","Protocols;Blockchains;Authentication;Privacy;Security;Proposals;Public key","","","","1","","","IEEE","5 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Channel hub allows transferring coins directly from one payment channel to another within the same hub, so that it can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment network. Compared with payment hub in literature, which connects participant nodes, our channel hub is more efficient and lightweight, because it connects channels already constructed by the payment network. Based on channel hub, we design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain cross-channel transfers. We present the security definition of Boros and formally prove its security using the UC-framework.

This model has various fields of application including data collection from the Internet-of-Things and second-hand markets. Our main contribution is to propose a reputation-based protocol to help governors evaluate the reliability of collectors. Specifically, given a transaction, each governor runs a softmax-based function to calculate a probability for each collector that sent and labeled this transaction. The probabilities, calculated using collectors' reputations as inputs, represent the likelihood of the lead governor selecting the labeled transaction from collectors to consider for further validation. After the lead governor verifies a transaction, all collectors' reputations are updated in line with the agreement of their labeling and the validity of the transaction as found by the lead governor. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our protocol can significantly reduce governors' verification workloads while maintaining firm liveness and high incentives.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2021.3130244","Qing Lan Project for Young Academic Leaders; The National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632017,11871366,61803279); Qing Lan Project for Key Teachers; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9626619","Permissioned blockchain;Transaction verification;Reputation algorithm;Hierarchical structure","Blockchains;Protocols;Logic gates;Reliability;Sensors;Peer-to-peer computing;Costs","","","","1","","","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

With an exponential rise in Electric vehicles (EVs) usage across the globe, there is a requirement of developing a seamless charging infrastructure for charging and billing. Moreover, secure information flow needs to be maintained at different levels in such an environment. Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-based demand response management for efficient energy trading between EVs and CSs. In this proposal, miner nodes and block verifiers are selected using their power consumption and processing power. These nodes are responsible for the authentication of various transactions in the proposal. We also proposed a game theory-based solution to support energy management and peak load control off-peak and peak conditions. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics where its performance is found superior in comparison to the existing solutions in the literature.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3131815","Institutional Fund Projects(grant numbers:IFPHI-176-611-2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9652091","Vehicle-to-grid;electric vehicles;scheduling;blockchain;game theory.","Vehicle-to-grid;Green products;Renewable energy sources;Blockchains;Demand response;Privacy;Electric vehicle charging","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The negotiation of the volume and price of the peer-to-peer electricity trading among prosumers is modeled as a cooperative game, and the interaction between a retailer and its ensemble of prosumers is modeled as a Stackelberg game. The flexibility provision from residential heating systems is incorporated into the energy scheduling of prosumers. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed architecture in local electricity markets helps improve local energy balance. Flexibility from the residential heating systems enables prosumers to be more responsive to the variation of retail electricity prices.

In this paper, we propose a new storage structure for blockchain transactions, called Coloring Index (CI), to reduce the blockchain's space occupation. Specifically, we devise an index building algorithm to simply calculate the indices of transactions for the sake of information concealing. By improving the Coloring Embedder for multi-sets query, we can store the indices into the Coloring Embedder to achieve the structured storage of transactions with small space occupation. Using CI, SPV query proceeds without revealing the user's address, thereby achieving secure data sharing in applications such as the intelligent vehicles' communications and distributed IoT. We prove CI's security against malicious full nodes when establishing possible connections between the address and the user.

Herein, a secure blockchain-enabled V2V communication system (BVCS) is proposed to enhance the security of vehicles and secure data sharing and communication among vehicles. The developed smart contracts in this paper can authenticate users and their vehicles automatically. In this paper, the proposed algorithms can authenticate users, detect unauthorized access, and establish secure communication between vehicles. The proposed system can enhance data security, user privacy, and vehicle security and provide a trusted environment in V2V communication systems.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3226626","University Research Scholar (URS-SRF), through the University of Kalyani, Kalyani, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9990577","Blockchain technology;blockchain in C-V2X;smart contracts;V2V communication;vehicle security","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Security;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Communication systems;Data privacy;Authentication","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Therefore, e-commerce platforms require a secure reputation service, which provides genuine reputation of sellers so as to support potential buyers making the right decision while interacting with an e-commerce platform. Unfortunately, most current e-commerce platforms failed to do so because they fully control the reputation service, which make it easy for an adversary to violate the genuineness of the reputation. In this article, we focus on feedback anonymity and authenticity, which are two critical security properties to ensure a genuine reputation of sellers. We present Truth, a blockchain-aided secure reputation system to remove the trustworthiness of the e-commerce platform while ensuring the two security properties. To overcome the usability and security barriers of blockchain systems, Truth adopts a hybrid framework to rely on the centralized e-commerce platform to provide traditional trading services while the blockchain is only used to authenticate the correctness of feedbacks. To decouple the blockchain from the e-commerce platform, we anchor correctness of feedbacks to correctness of cryptographic tokens and leverage the blockchain to solely escrow the tokens. The Truth also proposes a new concept named purchasing endorsed feedback, which is enforced via a collaborative method to prevent injection of fake feedbacks. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate that the Truth incurs second-level computation overhead and KB-level communication overhead, and achieves hundreds TPS-level thoughts.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3128930","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172328); Blockchain Core Technology Strategic Research Program of Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2020KJ010801); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2021JM-344); Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Intelligent Processing for Big Energy Data(grant numbers:IPBED7); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1402700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9720484","Anonymity;authenticity;blockchain;e-commerce;reputation system","Blockchains;Electronic commerce;Usability;Public key;Currencies;Business;Negative feedback","","","","1","","","IEEE","24 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, existing access control solutions are not generally lightweight or scalable, particularly for geographically disperse, inexpensive resource constrained IoT devices. To tackle above challenges, we propose a lightweight consortium blockchain based architecture to enable intelligent autonomous access control for IoT devices. In our architecture, intelligent blockchain facilitates the storing of access policies, provision of authentication services for data access control, and trust evaluation for access request nodes through token accumulation mechanism. Specifically, the user's access request is approved only after it is confirmed by the blockchain network. To ensure the reliability of authenticity, a compromised resistant consensus algorithm is adapted and implemented to defend against at most 1/3 compromised authenticators. In addition, a cross-domain and flexible access control model is not only used to support data sharing among various users but can also be used for access control for exceptional blockchain situations. We explain how our system meets our design goals of reliability, availability, confidentiality, integrity, lightweight, security and scalability. In addition, we also analyze the proposed system's performance from computational, storage and network overheads (e.g. running cryptographic algorithms on a Raspberry Pi 4B), and the findings suggest that the time to run typical cryptographic algorithms is in the microsecond range.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3179727","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:No. 61972366); Henan Key Laboratory of Network Cryptography Technology(grant numbers:No. LNCT2020-A01); Yunnan Key Laboratory of Blockchain Application Technology(grant numbers:No. 202105AG070005, No. YNB202103); State Key Laboratory of Public Big Data(grant numbers:No. PBD2021-02); Provincial Key Research and Development Program of Hubei(grant numbers:No. 2020BAB105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9786793","Blockchain;Access Control;Cross-domain Accessing;Internet of Things","Access control;Blockchains;Internet of Things;Servers;Security;Authentication;Bitcoin","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the untrusted party’s misuse of the UAV may violate the security and even demolish the critical operation in the IoMT system. In addition, data manipulation and falsification using unauthorized access are the significant challenges of the IoMT system. In response to this problem, this study proposes a blockchain integrated convolution neural network (CNN)-based intelligent framework named IoMT-Net for identification and tracking illegal UAV in the IoMT system. Blockchain technology prevents illicit access, data manipulation, and illegal intrusions, as well as stored data on the central control server (CCS). Concurrently, the proposed CNN analyzed the radio frequency signal sent by the antenna array element to determine the direction of arrival (DoA) for the localization of the illegal UAV. Therefore, a signal model is designed to processes the received signal array through IoMT-Net. Moreover, the proposed CNN model is designed with two different functional modules, such as the resource accuracy trade-off (RAT) module and the unique feature extraction and accuracy boosting (UAB) module, by adopting depth-wise and grouped convolution layers. These sparsely connected convolution layers offer high DoA estimation accuracy while maintaining the network more lightweight. In addition, the skip connection is also leveraged into the sub-units of RAT and UAB modules for sharing features and handling the vanishing gradients problem. Based on the simulation results, the proposed network achieves superior DoA estimation accuracy (approximately 97.63% accuracy at 10 dB SNR) and outperforms other state-of-the-art models.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3176310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9778246","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization;convolution neural network (CNN);Internet-of-military-things (IoMT);peer-to-peer (P2P) authentication.","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Blockchains;Arrays;Multiple signal classification;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Security","","","","5","","","IEEE","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The main results show that when goodwill loss is high, the retailer always prefers blockchain; when this loss is medium, the retailer prefers blockchain only if both the unit production cost and proportion of authentic products are low.

The Artificial Immune Algorithm (AIA) is an intelligent method to imitate the function of the biological immune system, which provides a new solution for solving complex distributed problems. Firstly, a blockchain digital currency product is proposed based on AIA. Secondly, taking the credit risk of innovation risk in financial currency products as an example, the Diffie-Hellman (DH) with blockchain technology is used. Finally, the generation and optimization of the plan are realized, and an innovative risk plan is proposed for blockchain digital currency products on the basis of AIA.

Nonetheless, the current blockchains suffer from several flaws, especially the low performance and scalability. They seriously hinder the blockchain deployments in 6G-empowered IoT with high concurrency and complexity. To address this problem, we need to better understand blockchains and try to optimize them. However, we still lack a standard tool for comprehensively benchmarking the IoT-oriented blockchains in 6G era. As to blockchain optimization, the current general-purpose strategies can hardly hold efficiency all the time due to the heterogeneity of 6G-empowered IoT. In this paper, we present a novel pipeline for facilitating the green IoT-oriented blockchains in 6G era, called “fine-grained benchmarking + targeted optimization"". Specifically, we first design a benchmarking framework which realizes the whole workflow of data acquisition, log parsing, and metric visualization, offering quantitative blockchain performance reports. Moreover, our framework provides ten metrics divided into four dimensions, leading blockchain benchmarking to the fine-grained level. Based on the acquired insights, we further present the concept of targeted optimization, i.e., directly designing optimization strategies based on the metrics that perform poorly in benchmarking. To better illustrate this pipeline, we take IOTA, the most potential IoT-oriented blockchain in 6G era, as a case study. We observe two defects of IOTA, i.e., low power efficiency and slow ledger synchronization. Following our pipeline, we design two targeted optimization mechanisms, namely Proof-of-Resource Efficiency and Dynamic Local Snapshot Protocol. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can maximize the optimization efficiency, successfully addressing the issues hindering IOTA. Last but not least, we emphasize that the proposed pipeline can also be applied by other IoT-oriented blockchains in the 6G era.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2022.3185610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804858","Internet of Things (IoT);6G;Blockchain;Benchmarking;Performance Optimization","Blockchains;6G mobile communication;Benchmark testing;Internet of Things;Optimization;Measurement;Pipelines","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

By storing data on multiple chains, blockchains can request data from other chains for calculation and the storage pressure can be alleviated. But the transfer of a large amount of data between chains suffers from low transfer efficiency and poor security. A reasonable design is to perform the calculation on the data storage chain and only transfer the results across chains. However, since the calculation process is invisible, blockchains cannot judge the consistency of calculation results from other chains. In this paper, we provide a blockchain-enabled decentralized consistency verification scheme for cross-chain calculation (BeDCV). Considering the decentralized characteristic of blockchain, we adopt the blockchain called <italic>supervision chain</italic> for decentralized auditing. We modify paillier homomorphic encryption to encrypt data involved in the calculation for correctness verification. Then, we aggregate the ciphertexts of data to generate the audit proof for integrity verification. Besides, we verify whether the data involved in the calculation are real-time by leveraging a counting bloom filter. The supervision chain can check the correctness, integrity, and real-time performance of cross-chain data calculation without revealing any original information about the data. The theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates that BeDCV can verify the consistency of cross-chain data calculation result effectively, realizing secure and reliable expansion of blockchain.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2022.3196937","National Key R&amp;D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851945","Blockchain-enabled auditing;bloom filter;consistency verification;cross chain;data correctness;data integrity;homomorphic encryption","Blockchains;Homomorphic encryption;Cloud computing;Security;Real-time systems;Information filters;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Currently, there is a lack of quantitative and comprehensive models in the literature that researchers and practitioners can use to assess healthcare organizations’ readiness for blockchain adoption, particularly from multiple perspectives and using expert judgements. Thus, the objective of this article is to develop a scoring model to evaluate healthcare organization's readiness to adopt blockchain in the context of electronic health records system management. Specifically, in this article, a literature review and expert feedback were used to identify the most important factors influencing blockchain adoption. The outcomes of the article present an identification and prioritization of the blockchain adoption impacting factors. The article identified 17 factors. These factors are grouped into five perspective: financial, social, technical, organizational, and regulations and legal. The results of the article highlight that regulation compliance, regulation uncertainty, budget availability, management support, security and privacy, and financial risk and uncertainty play an important role in the organization's readiness for blockchain adoption. The readiness scoring model then developed and evaluated through two real-world case studies at two healthcare organizations. Two case studies were conducted to demonstrate the practicality of the research model, identify areas of deficiencies, and propose corrective actions in the healthcare organization's capabilities.

For many organic farms that contain crops with high unit prices, the environmental parameters of the crops grown on the farm are often regarded as confidential data. First, a wireless sensing network is used to transmit sensing data to the farm’s front-end integrated microcontroller for fusion of the sensing data. After fusion of the sensing data is completed, the processed data is transmitted to the data processing center of the entire farm for encapsulation of the blockchain algorithm. Data are sent to the cloud database for storage after they are packaged by the system. At the same time, the data in the cloud database can be managed and analyzed by remote operators. Data encapsulation based on blockchain technology is used to effectively prevent any data from being stolen or destroyed by hackers. A complete blockchain encapsulation database system is implemented in the experimental stage, and the operator can use this system to encrypt the data that have been fused at the remote end for blockchain technology. In the encryption process of this blockchain, the security of data processing can be specifically enhanced by the system. Finally, each encapsulated block of data is securely stored in a private cloud database. There is a function to check whether the data in the cloud have been tampered with.

Unfortunately, existing query APIs offered by the blockchain are inflexible and unscalable. Some studies propose off-chain solutions to provide more flexible and scalable query services. However, the query service providers (SPs) may deliver fake results without executing the real computation tasks and collude to cheat users. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent blockchain analytics platform termed iQuery, in which we design a game theory based smart contract to ensure the trustworthiness of the query results at a reasonable monetary cost. Furthermore, the contract introduces the second opinion game that employs a randomized SP selection approach coupled with non-ordered asynchronous querying primitive to prevent collusion. We achieve a fixed price equilibrium, destroy the economic foundation of collusion, and can incentivize all rational SPs to act diligently with proper financial rewards. In particular, iQuery can flexibly support semantic and analytical queries for generic consortium or public blockchains, achieving query scalability to massive blockchain data. Extensive experimental evaluations show that iQuery is significantly faster than state-of-the-art systems. Specifically, in terms of the conditional, analytical, and multi-origin query semantics, iQuery is 2 ×, 7 ×, and 1.5 × faster than advanced blockchain and blockchain databases. Meanwhile, to guarantee 100% trustworthiness, only two copies of query results need to be verified in iQuery, while iQuery's latency is $2 \sim 134$ × smaller than the state-of-the-art systems.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3228908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983476","Blockchain;second opinion smart contract;game theory;data analytics;query platform","Blockchains;Semantics;Smart contracts;Games;Game theory;Relational databases;Databases","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Blockchain, which supports cryptocurrency and creates full traceability of the service history of each car and driver, may come to rescue by allowing the platform to offer only the “safe cars” to consumers. Motivated by the real world challenges associated with the CoV outbreak for the ODR platform, we build game-theoretical models based on the M/M/n queuing system to explore if and how blockchain can help. In the basic model, the ODR platform decides the service price and special hygiene level. Comparing between the cases with and without blockchain, we find that blockchain implementation increases both the service price and hygiene level. In addition, when the consumers’ inherent worry of infection is substantially large, implementing blockchain achieves all-win for the ODR platform, drivers and consumers. In the extended models, we first consider the case when the special hygiene level is determined by the drivers under a mixed-leadership game and then explore the case when customers are risk averse. The main findings about blockchain adoption remain valid in both cases. However, when the drivers take charge of the special hygiene level, both optimal decisions are lower in most cases. It is also important to make efforts to reduce consumers’ feeling volatility toward service valuation for improving the value of blockchain adoption and related performances.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3131044","Yushan Fellow Program(grant numbers:NTU-110VV012); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72071113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9674809","Blockchain;coronavirus outbreak;pricing;ride-hailing platform operations","Blockchains;Vehicles;COVID-19;Pricing;Biological system modeling;DVD;Analytical models","","","","","","","IEEE","7 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

So whether platforms choose to adopt manual technology or blockchain technology for authentication is a problem worthy of attention. In this article, we investigate the choice strategy of authentication technology for luxury e-commerce platform(s) in the monopoly and duopoly markets, respectively. The results show that the choice of authentication technology for platform(s) depends on the cost difference between manual technology authentication and blockchain technology authentication. When the cost difference is small (large), platform(s) should adopt blockchain (manual) technology. In particular, in the duopoly market, the competition between the two platforms will improve their motivation to adopt blockchain technology, but the two platforms may trap into a prisoner's dilemma when they both adopt blockchain technology.

The storage challenge is one of the major barriers to the adoption of blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of many resource constrained devices. In this paper, we propose Multi-Level Distributed Caching (MLDC) for blockchain storage optimisation which reduces data replication based on data access patterns in a decentralised manner. For storage optimisation of data-centric blockchains, MLDC introduces a hierarchical storage class (SC), in which every node is assigned to an SC with its own Access Frequency (AF) threshold based on node availability. To reduce the number of replications shared among participant nodes, each node in a SC continues to remove unaccessed data from local storage based on a threshold time determined by the AF threshold of the SC, while maintaining all block hashes for consistency. Eventually, all nodes in MLDC store the most frequently accessed data in their local storage, so MLDC effectively reduces the storage and query costs while minimising network overhead. We also analyse the security of MLDC and quantitatively evaluate its performance for both the uniform access and exponentially decaying access patterns. The evaluation was carried out on a representative blockchain simulator with 15 storage nodes. Our results from 11 hours of experiments producing 6667 blocks and 39997 transactions show good performance for MLDC. The results of the experimentation for the exponentially decaying assess pattern show that MLDC can reduce the total storage cost by 83% compared to conventional blockchain systems, while maintaining blockchain consistency and data availability with a slight increase in network overhead and query cost.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3224735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964121","Blockchain;Internet of Things (IoT);Storage optimisation;Distributed caching","Blockchains;Security;Optimization;Costs;Internet of Things;Computer science;Australia","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Specifically, a realistic SINR model is adopted to depict the unreliable transmissions in wireless channels. Based on the SINR model, a distributed and randomized consensus algorithm is proposed to reach k-times consensus among n devices within O(k+logn) time steps with high probability. Note that the time complexity of our algorithm is asymptotically optimal since Ω(k+logn) is a lower bound to achieve k-times consensus in a distributed environment. We conduct both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations to validate our method.

For each off-chain storage node, key-value (KV) stores are normally used to manage data. As the most common data structure for KV store, Log Structured Merge Tree (LSM-Tree) eliminates random write operations and keeps acceptable read performance. Although LSM-Tree-based decentralized storage system can provide a secure and reliable storage platform, the unique feature of blockchain applications is not fully exploited. In blockchain storage applications, the generation of keys for KV stores is based on the encrypted data, and the key determines the allocation of data. Since the granularity for a read/write request at the level of blockchain storage platform is much smaller than that at the level of LSM-Tree or flash memory, a physical block in a solid-state drive (SSD) could be filled with data from different system users. This mixture of workloads will lead to the inefficient usage of physical spaces in the SSD and cause extra compaction operations for LSM-Tree. This paper presents Meta-Block, a cross-layer and efficient storage management strategy for decentralized blockchain storage applications. Meta-Block utilizes rich functionalities provided by the system infrastructure of open-channel SSD to provide direct storage accesses for the off-chain storage node. The objective is to capture the features of blockchain storage applications and reduce unnecessary read and write operations across different storage layers. As a cross-layer design, Meta-Block redesigns the organization of LSM-Tree, which can effectively reduce the write amplification. We also design a data prefetching strategy to speed up the indexing and enable direct storage access. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed technique using a set of extensive experiments. Experimental results show that Meta-Block can effectively reduce the write amplification and extend the lifetime of SSDs in comparison with representative schemes.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2022.3226305","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972259,62072311,62122056,62102263,U2001212); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B151502055,2020B1515120028,2022A1515010180); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20210324094402008,JCYJ20210324094208024); Key Laboratory of Popular Type of High-performance Computer of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017B030314073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9969144","Decentralized Storage Systems;Blockchain Storage;KV Stores;LSM-Tree;Open-Channel SSD","Blockchains;Compaction;Cryptography;Cross layer design;Peer-to-peer computing;Resource management;Prefetching","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Using pyRAPL, a python library to measure the energy consumption of a computation, we experiment with both the standard and energy-reduced implementations of both algorithms for different input sizes. Our results show that up to 98% reduction in energy consumption is possible within the blockchain’s MT construction module, with the benefits typically increasing with larger input sizes. For the PoW algorithm, our results show up to 20% reduction in energy consumption, with the benefits being lower for higher difficulty levels.

However, the existing blockchain-based data sharing schemes mainly consider data privacy. Only a few works can support anonymity with strong, trusted assumptions. Thus, there is a research gap on the anonymity of blockchain-based data sharing for IoT, which does not rely on any trusted party. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous data sharing scheme (BA-DS) by adopting a novel public key encryption derived from a ring signature. In BA-DS, we remove the trusted party and ensure anonymity by using an unconditional linkable ring signature and signature of knowledge (SoK). During the revocation, we apply blockchain infrastructure to record the valid revocation list and generate a tag for data stored on the cloud, providing solid accountability. The formal security analysis shows that BA-DS is selective indistinguishable secure in the random oracle model. Additionally, we also prove that BA-DS holds anonymity, data privacy, accountability, and authenticity.

Under PoW, miners maintain the security of blockchain by devoting computing powers to solve the puzzle; the miner who has solved the puzzle successfully generates a block, along with a reward (e.g., a set of cryptocurrency). The average waiting time to generate a block is inversely proportional to the computing power of the miner. To reduce the average block generation time, a group of individual miners can form a centralized mining pool to aggregate their computing power to solve the puzzle together and share the reward contained in the block. However, if the aggregated computing power of the pool forms a substantial portion of the total computing power in the network, the pooled mining undermines the core spirit of blockchain, i.e., the decentralization, and harms its security. To discourage the pooled mining, we develop a new consensus protocol called Proof-of-Age (PoA) that builds upon the native PoW protocol. The core idea of PoA lies in using Age-of-Work (AoW) to measure the effective mining periods that the miners have devoted to maintaining the security of blockchain. Unlike in the native PoW protocol, in our PoA protocol, miners benefit from its effective mining periods even if they have not successfully mined a block. We first employ a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) to model the block generation process of the PoA based blockchain. Based on this CTMC model, we then analyze the block generation rates of the mining pool and solo miners respectively. Our analytical results verify that under PoA, the block generation rates of miners in the mining pool are reduced compared to that of solo miners, thereby disincentivizing the pooled mining. Finally, we simulate the mining process in the PoA blockchain to demonstrate the consistency of the analytical results.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2022.3226496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9969914","Blockchain;PoW;pooled mining;proof-of-age;continuous time markov chain","Blockchains;Data mining;Security;Consensus protocol;Transmitters;Peer-to-peer computing;Computational modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

There is a public channel used to collect data from humans and send it to the cloud, which is highly unreliable and vulnerable to attacks. Another risk is storing data in a single centralized system, which can be vulnerable to a single-point failure. Blockchain is being used for secure data storage in a decentralized manner to avoid single-point failure.

Therefore, this article proposes a blockchain-based anonymous system, known as GarliMediChain, for providing anonymity and privacy during COVID-19 information sharing. In GarliMediChain, garlic routing and blockchain are integrated to provide low-latency communication, privacy, anonymity, trust, and security. Also, COVID-19 information is encrypted multiple times before transmitting to a series of nodes in the network. To ensure that COVID-19 information is successfully shared, a blockchain-based coalition system is proposed. The coalition system enables health institutions to share information while maximizing their payoffs. In addition, each institution uses the proposed fictitious play to study the strategies of others in order to update its belief by selecting the best responses from them. Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed system is resistant to security-related attacks and is robust, efficient, and adaptive. From the results, the proposed proof-of-epidemiology-of-interest consensus protocol has 15.93% less computational cost than 26.30% of proof-of-work and 57.77% proof-of-authority consensus protocol, respectively.

Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3186945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9819963","Blockchain;healthcare;information and communication technology (ICT);Internet of Things (IoT);InterPlanetary file system (IPFS);proxy re-encryption;remote patient monitoring;security","Medical services;Blockchains;Security;Diseases;Smart contracts;Internet of Things;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The blockchain mining process requires high computing power to solve a Proof-of-Work (PoW) puzzle, which is hard to implement on users’ mobile devices. So these miners may leverage the edge/cloud service providers (ESPs/CSP) to calculate the PoW puzzle. The existing edge-assisted blockchain networks assumed that all ESPs have a uniform propagation delay, which is unrealistic. In this paper, we consider a more practical scene where ESPs locate in diverse positions of the blockchain network, which causes different propagation delays when supporting the computation of the PoW puzzle. Additionally, these ESPs connect to a remote CSP for resource scheduling when the computing tasks exceed their maximum capacity. The blockchain mining process generally involves complicated competition and games among CSP, ESPs, and miners. Each service provider focuses on how to determine his resource price so that he can maximize his utility. According to the set resource price, each miner concentrates on scheduling his resource requests for each ESP to maximize individual personal utility, which depends on ESPs’ resource price and propagation delays. We first model such a resource pricing and scheduling problem as a three-stage multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game and aim at finding the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we analyze the subgame optimization problem in each stage and propose an iterative algorithm based on backward induction to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the significant performance of the proposed solution.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3177438","NSF of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:21KJB520025); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873177,62072322,62102275,U20A20182); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS 1564128,CNS 1629746,CNS 1651947,CNS 1757533,CNS 1824440,CNS 1828363); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province in China(grant numbers:BK20210704); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780585","Blockchain;edge computing;game theory;resource pricing;resource scheduling;propagation delay","Blockchains;Propagation delay;Bitcoin;Games;Servers;Convergence;Task analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","24 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Nevertheless, in such a complicated, distributed, and highly mobile network structure, how to achieve secure data sharing is a great challenge. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a potential method to realize one-to-many data sharing for VANET. However, the key abuse problems of users and attribute authorities (AAs) incur many security concerns for VANET. Both issues are extremely important because the attribute keys directly affect users’ access to shared data. To solve the above issues, we propose an accountable attribute-based data sharing scheme with blockchain technology (AT-DS-VAHN, in short). For AAs key abuse, we use the consortium blockchain maintained by AAs to achieve distributed key storage and distribution. The attribute keys generated by each AA and its key distribution records are recorded on the blockchain in the form of transactions. Based on the traceability of blockchain, the key abuse behaviour of AAs can be caught and prosecuted. For user key abuse, we achieve white-box traceability and efficient user revocation. Based on the principle of traceable-then-revocable, malicious users can be tracked and then revoked directly from the system without complex operations. Besides, to reduce the computation burden on users, our proposal supports online/offline encryption and verifiable outsourced decryption.

Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL framework that features the integration of training and mining at the client side. To optimize the learning performance of FL, we propose to maximize the long-term time average (LTA) training data size under a constraint of LTA energy consumption. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of training client selection and resource allocation (i.e., the transmit power and computation frequency at the client side), and solve the long-term mixed integer non-linear programming based on a Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling (DRACS) algorithm can achieve a trade-off of [O(1/V), O(√V)] to balance the maximization of the LTA training data size and the minimization of the LTA energy consumption with a control parameter V.

However, for an untrusted or vulnerable cloud server, the stored IoT data can be easily accessed, modified and even destroyed given that the IoT data are stored in total centralization. Moreover, the servers in a cloud are generally homogeneous and thus vulnerable to attacks. For improvements, we design a novel framework for secure and efficient IoT data storage based on secret sharing and a collaborative blockchain. First, an ultra-lightweight secret sharing algorithm is designed to map original messages generated by IoT devices to a set of shorter message shares. Second, all the shares of IoT messages are separately delivered to different clouds for storage. To guarantee the security of shares, the delivery is notarized on a proposed blockchain. Specifically, both hash values of the shares and their information of location are embedded in blocks which are then chained to form a blockchain. Third, we create a balanced index structure about the shares for each cloud storage node based on the information in the blockchain, and we also propose a depth-first data search algorithm to improve IoT data retrieval efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a new PCI scheme to achieve privacy preservation and transparency with the assistance of a consortium blockchain. Specifically, a blockchain is first established by a group of consortium members, and each IC can deploy insurance contracts on the blockchain to support public verification of data collection/processing and thus fulfill the transparency requirement. Then a verifiable and privacy-preserving driving behavior evaluation protocol is designed by tailoring partially homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof techniques. Drivers can use the protocol to interact with ICs through the contracts, and ICs can learn drivers' behavior and set corresponding auto premiums by analyzing encrypted driving data. Furthermore, a third-party auditor (TPA) is authorized by drivers and ICs to audit encrypted driving data on the contracts and resist fraud attacks. We model the contract-based auditing as a recursive inspection game where TPA can minimize the number of audits to detect data fraud and penalize malicious drivers according to Nash equilibrium. Therefore, the proposed PCI scheme can guarantee that most of the collected driving data are not biased. Formal simulation-based security analysis is given to prove the security of the proposed scheme, and a proof-of-concept prototype is also developed on an open-source blockchain to demonstrate the feasibility.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3215811","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001220); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200440); Huawei Technologies Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9924540","Personalized car insurance;blockchain;privacy preservation;fraud resistance;data auditing","Vehicles;Insurance;Behavioral sciences;Integrated circuit modeling;Blockchains;Safety;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The data volume grows undesirably large in practice. It prevents the widely used devices, e.g., tablets and mobile phones, to join blockchain systems due to their limited storage and computing resource. Previous work addressed the storage issue by allowing participating nodes to only keep a fraction of the entire transaction set, e.g., sharding. However, existing studies focus on transaction placement with the minimum cross-shard communications. These studies neglect the node characteristics (e.g., storage capacity, cost, and response capability), which impacts the storage performance adversely. In this paper, we propose EBSF, a block storage framework that achieves efficient block storage by constructing a block allocation plan based on node characteristics. Blockchain nodes are organized into committees such that nodes in a committee work together to maintain the entire blockchain data. We formulate the block allocation plan problem that assigns each block to at least one node in a committee. The goal is to minimize the total cost while reaching the threshold of the response capability of each block. We prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose heuristic algorithms. We also propose two strategies to handle the dynamic scenario of new blocks. Extensive evaluation shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3188521","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902040); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2021JJ30741); Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:20B015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9815282","Blockchain;Storage;Block Allocation Plan;Scalability","Blockchains;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Costs;Bitcoin;Scalability;Throughput","","","","","","","IEEE","5 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Frequent incidences of fraudulent practices expose lack of transparency in agri-food supply chains, causing concerns related to economic losses, eroding consumer trust and enterprise brand value. Traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies, banking and finance, blockchains are now being applied in the agri-food sector to address supply chain-related challenges. This article examines the question: How blockchain technology facilitates transparency in agri-food supply chains? Primary attributes of blockchain, namely traceability, immutability, auditability, and provenance, promote transparency in supply chains. Using thematic analysis, the following three areas were identified for implementing blockchain in agri-food supply chains: first, agri-food distribution; second, agri-food origin and sourcing; third, agri-food safety and quality. By cross-mapping thematic areas with primary attributes, our analysis resulted in classification of 25 uses cases. Preliminary findings of this study highlight blockchain-enabled transparency via contemporary uses cases in conceptual, proof-of-concept and commercial stages.

In this paper, we propose a low-cost, seamless cross-border payment system based on an auditable cryptocurrency that enables unspent transaction output-based transactions in a consortium blockchain network. To manage the blockchain, participating countries execute the energy-efficient proof of authority consensus algorithm with equal rights. Unlike conventional cryptocurrencies, dynamic decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are used as transacting addresses so that self-manageable authentication can be performed on-chain without any interaction with a trusted third party. The identity of transacting parties is known to respective DID issuers only. This approach enables peer-to-peer transactions while protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency without jeopardizing auditability. For user convenience, multi-party computation and multi-signature protocols are also provided. The system was implemented in Python, and the transaction mechanism was tested.

However, the existing data storage and exchange solutions in the healthcare domain exhibit several challenges related to e.g., data security, patient privacy, and interoperability. Recently, the industry and research community turned its focus to the possible use of blockchain technology to solve some of these challenges in the healthcare domain. The blockchain technology along with the support from smart contracts is considered a salient facilitator for secure and efficient health data sharing. This is due to its unique features, such as decentralization, trustlessness, immutability, traceability, and transparency. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art efforts that envision the use of blockchain-based solutions in the healthcare domain. To this end, we introduce a systematic framework for classifying and analyzing such systems. The framework consists of classification in several dimensions: interactions between healthcare entities, functional components of healthcare storage systems, challenges in the healthcare domain that can be overcome by using the blockchain technology, and benefits for healthcare storage systems derived from the fundamental features of the technology. When analyzing over 40 systems and solutions proposed in the state-of-the-art, we perform their rigorous placement by identifying the exact scope of each solution and mapping it to the above taxonomies of interactions, functional components, challenges, and benefits.

To utilize these scattered AIS data for further analysis, there are multiple AIS data platforms collecting AIS data from vessels around the world through their satellites and land-based stations. Thus, users can obtain AIS data of vessels from these platforms without dedicated devices. However, existing platforms work in silos, and AIS data is distributed across different platforms, resulting in reduced data availability. In addition, AIS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, which can undermine the authenticity of AIS data. In this paper, we propose AISChain, a secure and fast blockchain-based AIS data platform. AISChain adopts consortium blockchain, which only permits those authorized parties (i.e., AIS data providers) to participate in the consensus protocol, and is compatible with current commodity AIS hardware. Since the whole system is co-maintained by multiple authorized parties, AISChain can integrate AIS data resources in a secure way. For avoiding repeated recording of AIS data on the chain, we design the Dynamic Bloom Filter Tree (DBFT) to realize efficient duplication detection in the transaction verification phase. We also propose the dual signature scheme to clarify the AIS data ownership. Moreover, we leverage the geographical location-based blockchain sharding approach to further improve the scalability of AISChain. We implement a prototype of AISChain, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of AISChain. Evaluation results show that the search time of DBFT is negligible (4.3 ms) with an extreme low error ratio (0.4%). Meanwhile, AISChain can achieve more than 730 tx/s throughput even when nodes scale to 36.

With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the above issues can be resolved by leveraging the tamper-resistance and decentralization characteristics of blockchain. However, post the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) in 2018, the protection of data owners has taken center stage. This has led to several principles of personal data deletion, such as Storage Limit and the Right to Be Forgotten to conflict with the blockchain. It is also observed that, out of the various smart contracts deployed to manage digital assets, often only specific smart contracts are invoked, while the rest of the deployed smart contracts are rarely invoked, leading to smart contract designs exhibiting similar patterns with very little creativity. This current scenario has motivated us to propose SPChain, a smarter and private GDPR-compliant digital asset management framework enabled by blockchain. In this approach, a decentralized InterPlanetary File System has been adopted to solve the problem of SPOF. In addition, the combination of digital assets with artificial intelligence models has been proposed so as to make digital assets accessible to a larger number of applications and to enable better creativity. In this design, artificial intelligence models have been run in independent, virtualized containers and invoked through smart contracts. The proposed SPChain can be applied to the field of digital art management to provide a complete implementation based on the Hyperledger Fabric. Using this proposed framework, model developers, digital art creators, collectors, service providers, as well as third parties can not only benefit from securely managing digital assets and combining them with AI models, but also from simultaneously complying with the rights stipulated in the GDPR. During the course of the experiments conducted, the latency, throughput, and resource consumption of different functions in the smart contracts have been measured. After adjusting the batch timeout of the block and the maximum number of transactions in a block, the throughputs were observed to be about 500 TPS, with 10 to 15 TPS for reading and writing operations, respectively.

With outstanding advantages in decentralized authentication, blockchain provides new effective solutions for decentralized identity authentication in CBTC. Consequently, it is critical to study the complex physical consequences of cyber breaches from a cross-layer defense perspective.

In the cyber layer, an asymmetric encryption-based secure communication protocol with identity authentication and the blockchain-based distributed key management system with the adaptive consensus mechanism are designed for data communication security. Considering the unavailable direct observation of the CBTC cyber security states, a partially observable Markov (POMDP) decision model is constructed to derive the optimal adaptive consensus strategies for balancing cyber security and efficiency. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed blockchain empowered CBTC cross-layer defense method can effectively improve the cyber security protection capability and minimize the impact of data tampering attacks on the train operation.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3211020","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2021YJS201,2021CZ107); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973026); Beijing Municipal Education Commission Funding(grant numbers:I20H100010,I19H100010); Beijing Science and Technology Commission Funding(grant numbers:Z191100010818001); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L181004,L201002); Beijing Jiaotong University Project(grant numbers:RCS2021ZZ005,RCS2019ZT010,RCS2018K008,2021CZ107,2018JBZ002); Beijing Traffic Control Technology (BJTCT) Innovation Funding(grant numbers:9907006509); China State Railway Group Company Ltd., Science and Technology Research and Development Program(grant numbers:N2019G027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9917466","CBTC;data tampering attacks;cross-layer defense;blockchain","Blockchains;Cross layer design;Computer crime;Authentication;Protocols;Safety;Physical layer","","","","","","","IEEE","12 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Unfortunately, current personal data privacy protection schemes still suffer from explicit storage, lack of data ownership and implementation of fine-grained access control by users, and lack of transparency and auditability of data. In this article, we propose a personal data privacy protection scheme based on consortium blockchain that stores original data encrypted with an improved Paillier homomorphic encryption mechanism, namely PDPChain, where users realize fine-grained access control based on ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) on blockchain. In this scheme, consortium blockchain combines distributed private clusters to store the encrypted data, improving data transmission efficiency, and guaranteeing user privacy and security through off-chain storage and on-chain transmission synergy. In addition, it is more lightweight encryption and demarcation, ultimately protecting personal data privacy and providing a secure and trusted way to obtain information for data mining. For the performance testing, data in the form of files are used as an example, and the scheme is designed and simulated on Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System. Experimental results show that the improved Paillier encryption mechanism reduces the overall encryption and decryption elapsed time by 25% and encryption elapsed time by 48%. Furthermore, the proposed CP-ABE access control method is adaptive to storing and sharing a massive amount of data.

When transactions are transmitted through the channels created by nodes, the nodes need to cooperate with each other. If one party refuses to do so, the channel is unstable. A stable channel is thus required. Because nodes may show uncooperative behavior, they may have a negative impact on the stability of such channels. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a dynamic evolutionary game model based on node behavior. This model considers various defense strategies' cost and attack success ratio under them. Nodes can dynamically adjust their strategies according to the behavior of attackers to achieve their effective defense. The equilibrium stability of the proposed model can be achieved. The proposed model can be applied to general channel networks. It is compared with two state-of-the-art blockchain channels: Lightning network and Spirit channels. The experimental results show that the proposed model can be used to improve a channel's stability and keep it in a good cooperative stable state.

However, there are some essential issues to be considered: 1) privacy and authenticity of data transmission in IoV, and 2) reasonable resource allocation for collaborative computing and caching. In this paper, to solve above issues, blockchain technology is introduced and adopted to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data transmission and interaction.

This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework for blockchain-empowered spectrum trading for NS in RAN.

To address these security challenges, we design an anonymous authenticated key exchange mechanism for the IoVs in smart transportation supported by blockchain, referred to as AAKE-BIVT. AAKE-BIVT securely transmits traffic information to a cluster head, before heading to a nearby RSU utilizing the established secret session keys via mutual authentication and key agreement.

To address this problem, fair payment schemes, both blockchain-free and blockchain-based, have been proposed. However, the former is usually inefficient and the latter only supports payment through cryptocurrencies. The use of cryptocurrencies faces hurdles as it exposes cloud service providers to a significant risk of sharp currency price fluctuations, as well as vulnerability to government bans due to regulatory concerns. In contrast, fiat money payment is not only more in line with the business norm, but also naturally avoids the above troubles. Motivated by this, a blockchain-based fair outsourcing scheme to support payment in fiat money is proposed in this paper.

On the other hand, blockchain technology preserves distributed ledgers to ensure the immutability and transparency of data, which can further solve the security vulnerabilities caused by system centralization. This paper proposes a blockchain-assisted transformation method to solve all the key management problems mentioned above in ciphertext-policy ABE by utilizing technologies such as secret sharing protocols. In addition, our transformation method realizes two additional benefits: outsourced decryption and efficient user revocation, which are extremely valuable for practical implementations.

Hence, in this paper, we fill this gap by leveraging the large deviation theory to conduct the first micro study of natural forking, aiming to reveal its inherent mechanism substantially. Our work is featured by 1) conceptual innovation. We creatively abstract the blockchain overlay network as a “service system”. This allows us to investigate natural forking from the perspective of “supply and demand”. Based on this, we can identify the competitive dynamics of blockchain and construct a queuing model to characterize natural forking; 2) progressiveness. We scrutinize the natural forking probability as well as its decay rate via a three-step scheme from simple to complex, which are the single-source i.i.d. scheme, the single-source non-i.i.d. scheme, and the many-source non-i.i.d. scheme. By doing so, we can answer when and how fast should we take actions and what actions should we take against natural forking.

However, in the metaverse, UACs have opened a wide scope of bridges for individuals to shuttle the virtual world, which implies that numerous threats exist at the access layer due to a great pool of entries. In this paper, to solve security issues in the UAC setting of the metaverse, we propose a novel blockchain-based multisignature lock for UAC (BMSL-UAC) scheme.

To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a generic anonymous, confidential, and auditable transaction system (named ACA), which is compatible with both UTXO-based permissionless and permissioned blockchains.

The proposed control approach is the first attempt to address cyber attacks with a hybrid of data and models, improving the resilience and robustness of DC microgrids. With the help of practical Byzantine ideas, the proposed strategy preserves the resilience strengths of the blockchain against corruption and discards its shortcomings of low real-time performance, significantly enhancing the security without compromising the dynamic performance of the system by active intervention. Subsequently, a bound on the communication delay induced by the blockchain network under the expected security index is given based on the theoretical analysis. Unlike the existing practice of passively tolerating communication delays and packet dropouts, the predictive control method proposed in this paper actively compensates for them experienced by DC microgrids. Then, an analytical model of the closed-loop DC microgrid system is developed, and stability analysis is presented accordingly. Finally, several experimental tests performed on a PV-based DC microgrid hardware system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2022.3217807","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073247,62173255,62188101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9931989","DC microgrids;blockchain protocol;communication constraints;networked predictive control;delay compensation;cyber attacks;voltage restoration and current sharing","Microgrids;Blockchains;Cyberattack;Predictive control;Delays","","","","","","","IEEE","28 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

IoV also promises rich location-based services for vehicles, such as parking and toll highway. However, preserving privacy for location-based service payments emerges as a critical and challenging problem in IoV. Existing schemes rely on centralized banks for payment processing, resulting in location privacy leakage to centralized entities. In this paper, we propose a decentralized privacy-preserving payment scheme named Vehicloak for IoV based on the blockchain technology. The biggest challenge is to provide location privacy for vehicles while guaranteeing correct service payments using the transparent blockchain. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new cryptographic technique called zk-GSigproof that integrates zero-knowledge proof with group signature. Vehicloak implements this technique in a smart contract to process payment, which verifies zero-knowledge proof and group signature without leaking location information. It is not limited to IoV and can be applied in many payment scenarios. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we implement Vehicloak on a private blockchain of 100 nodes on Aliyun, and conduct a test with up to 4,000 transactions. The experimental results prove the feasibility of Vehicloak.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3193165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837445","Blockchain;group signature;location privacy;smart contract;zk-SNARK","Privacy;Blockchains;Security;Task analysis;Smart contracts;Mobile computing;Dedicated short range communication","","","","","","","IEEE","22 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In recent years, misbehavior detection systems have been developed to detect the malicious behaviour, and machine learning methods have been employed to make the detection more accurately. However, existing misbehavior detection systems typically require a single entity (e.g., a central server) for centralized data collection and training.

Additionally, blockchain is integrated into IoT to enhance the security of the environment. For that purpose, this research proposes Dynamic Secure Access Control using Blockchain (DSA-Block) model, which performs secure access control and data sharing. Initially, the IoT device attributes and user attributes are registered at a local domain authority (LDA) for generating private and public keys using the Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) algorithm, which ensures the legitimacy of the users and devices. Then, the IoT devices send a request message to the edge nodes via a gateway, which performs request filtration by validating the user’s authenticity. The filtered requests are sent to the edge server to perform access delegation using Rock Hyraxes Swarm Optimization (RHSO), which selects a set of delegator nodes. The access control decision is made by using the Trusted Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The IoT data are stored in the cloud server for secure storage, in which the data are secured using a differential privacy mechanism. Finally, dual revocations, such as user attribute revocation and user revocation, are used to maintain security.

Blockchain networks (BCNs) are a revolutionary way to establish trust in untrusted environments. In this complex environment, BCNs can help ensure transparency and security for network service LCM. However, BCNs are also vulnerable to quantum attacks. Advances in quantum computing will challenge the security of existing blockchain technology based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technologies. In this paper, we explore how network services can be managed in a multiple administrative scenario. Our approach uses BCNs to track the operational steps of network service instantiation metrics while benefiting from the security features of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Together with the use of N-th degree Truncated polynomial Ring Units (NTRU) as an example of a PQC algorithm that relies on the parallelization power of the Toom-Cook computation method with different security levels, we have shown that Quorum can provide a lower average time-to-write value compared to other BCNs considered (Ethereum and Hyperledger).

Big data systems take on a significant infrastructure service to better serve the purpose of IoT systems and support critical decision making. On the other hand, privacy preservation, data integrity, and identity verification are essential requirements in healthcare big data service management. To overcome these problems, this article offers a scalable computing system that provides verifiable data access mechanism for IoT-enabled health data analytics in the big data ecosystem. There are two primary sub-architectures in the proposed architecture, namely a big data analytics tracking system and a derived blockchain-based data storage/access system. This approach leverages big data systems and blockchain architecture to analyze, and securely store data from IoT-enabled devices and allow verified access to the stored data. The zero-knowledge protocol is used to ensure that no information is accessible to unauthenticated users alongside avoiding data linkability.

However, privacy and security problems remain largely unresolved in the safety area. Various rule-based methods have been considered to recognize aberrant behaviors in IoMT and have demonstrated high accuracy of misbehavior detection appropriate for lightweight IoT devices. However, most of these solutions have privacy concerns, especially when giving context during misbe- havior analysis. Moreover, falsified or modified context generates a high percentage of false positives and, in some cases, causes a by-pass in misbehavior detection. Relying on the recent pow- erful consolidation of Blockchain and federated learning (FL), we propose an efficient privacy-preserving framework for secure mis- behavior detection in lightweight IoMT devices, particularly in the artificial pancreas system (APS).

In this paper, we first summarize five essential issues that all sharding blockchain designers face. For each issue, we discuss its key challenge and propose our suggested solutions. In order to break the performance bottlenecks, we design a committee structure and propose a reputation mechanism for selecting leaders. The term reputation in our design reflects each node's honest computation resources. In addition, we present a recovery procedure in case the leader is malicious.

Seeking to address these limitations, this paper proposes an auditable anonymous user authentication (A2UA) protocol based on blockchain for cloud services. The A2UA protocol mainly employs bilinear pairing, partial authentication factors, dynamic credits and fake-public keys (FPKs) to achieve anonymous mutual authentication between users and cloud service providers, and applies ring signature and blockchain to accomplish two-level accountability while maintaining user privacy.

However, striking a balance between privacy, transparency, and auditability in such a system is technically difficult. We propose a CBDC system based on a consortium blockchain that adopts a privacy-preserving, transparent unspent transaction output (UTXO) model. The proposed system satisfies the travel rule of payment, unlike existing cryptocurrencies. Unlike the conventional UTXO approach, users use wallet-linked addresses for transactions rather than their actual wallet addresses. Each transacting address is generated using two keys: a random private key computed by the sender and the recipient's public key. The final private key is known only to the recipient, and it is required to spend the UTXO received using the address. Thus, each user holds only a single authorized public key and address, which eases regulatory compliance in the network without compromising anonymity and privacy. To manage the blockchain, the central bank and several certificate authorities execute the energy-efficient Clique consensus algorithm. Only the central bank supplies money to the network. A prototype of the system was implemented using Python-Flask, and it outperformed the state-of-the-art systems by providing a smaller transaction size (665 B) and lower verification time (9 ms).","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3226120","National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of the Korean government(grant numbers:NRF-2021R1A2C2012476); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9968120","Central bank digital currency;consortium blockchain;Clique consensus algorithm;unspent transaction output;elliptic curve cryptography","Blockchains;Privacy;Bitcoin;Public key;Distributed ledger;Consensus algorithm;Prototypes","","","","","","","CCBY","1 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The VFC is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, and existing security measures in traditional networks are not necessarily applicable to VFC. Among these attacks, we can find the Sybil attack that allows a vehicle to create multiple identities to perform malicious operations. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based mechanism to detect Sybil attacks in VFC networks. The detection process consists of two levels; the first one is targeted toward the verification of the vehicle’s position by the FN using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) technique. The FN delivers a position proof, if its position is valid, and stores it in the blockchain. At this point, the set of the obtained position proofs constitutes a trajectory. The second level is projected toward a comparison between the trajectories of the vehicles reporting an event. Two trajectories that pass through the same FNs at the same time, will be considered as Sybil trajectories. The objective of these two-level detections is to identify the Sybil attack in several attack scenarios performed by a powerful adversary. Our analysis shows that existing proposals cannot deal with such an adversary. Moreover, simulation results show the efficiency of our proposal in terms of communication, computation, and detection rate. Indeed, our system can reach a detection rate of 98% when the malicious vehicle generates several aliases simultaneously and sends position requests to the FN for each generated pseudonym.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3216073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925616","Blockchain;RSSI;Sybil attack;proof of location;trajectory;vehicular fog computing","Trajectory;Proposals;Cloud computing;Blockchains;Roads;Received signal strength indicator;Edge computing","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

MEC enables IoT devices to offload and execute their real-time applications at the proximity of these devices with low latency. Such applications include efficient manufacture inspection, virtual/augmented reality, image recognition, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and e-Health. However, task offloading experiences security and privacy attacks such as data tampering, private data leakage, data replication, etc. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based framework for secure task offloading in MEC systems with guaranteed performance in terms of execution delay and energy consumption. First, blockchain technology is introduced as a platform to achieve data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and privacy of task offloading in MEC. Second, we formulate an integration model of resource allocation and task offloading for a multi-user with multi-task MEC systems to optimize the energy and time cost. This is an NP-hard problem because of the curse-of-dimensionality and dynamic characteristics challenges of the considered scenario. Therefore, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed to derive the close-optimal task offloading decision efficiently. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is resilient to several task offloading security attacks and it can save about 22.2% and 19.4% of system consumption with respect to the local and edge execution scenarios. Moreover, the benchmark analysis proves that the framework consumes few resources in terms of memory and disk usage, CPU utilization, and transaction throughput.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3190493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9831127","Blockchain;Mobile Edge Computing;Task Offloading;Security;Privacy;Deep Reinforcement Learning","Task analysis;Blockchains;Internet of Things;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Hafnium;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

There have also been attempts to design blockchain-based CPPA schemes, but these schemes may not support key revocation or are inefficient (e.g., due to on-chain operations). This paper proposes an efficient blockchain-based CPPA (EBCPPA) scheme, which is designed to mitigate the above limitations. Our proposal consists of two key building blocks, namely: signature of knowledge and smart contract. To evaluate the feasibility, we present the security and performance analyses of EBCPPA. Specifically, the performance evaluations show that EBCPPA is more efficient than other existing state-of-the-art solutions, in terms of signing (improving at least 49.71%), the verification (improving at least 32.84%) and bandwidth requirement (reducing at least 27.59%).","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3204582","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA1000600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20466,61972294,61932016); Special Project on Science and Technology Program of Hubei Provience(grant numbers:2020AEA013); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020CFA052); Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2020010601012187); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:RSP-2022/12); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878244","Blockchain;VANETs;Conditional privacy-preserving;Signature of knowledge;Smart contract","Blockchains;Authentication;Security;Privacy;Public key;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Smart contracts","","","","","","","IEEE","6 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, ML/DL-based healthcare models still suffer from poor adoption due to the lack of realistic and recent medical data. The privacy nature of these medical datasets makes it difficult for clinicians and healthcare service providers, to share their sensitive data ($i.e.,$ Patient Health Records (PHR)). Thus, privacy-aware collaboration among clinicians and healthcare service providers is expected to become essential to build robust healthcare applications supported by next-generation networking (NGN) technologies, including Beyond sixth-generation (B6G) networks. In this paper, we design a new framework, called HealthFed, that leverages Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain technologies to enable privacy-preserving and distributed learning among multiple clinician collaborators. Specifically, HealthFed enables several distributed SDN-based domains, clinician collaborators, to securely collaborate in order to build robust healthcare ML-based models, while ensuring the privacy of each clinician participant. In addition, HealthFed ensures a secure aggregation of local model updates by leveraging a secure multiparty computation scheme ($i.e.,$ Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC)). Furthermore, we design a novel blockchain-based scheme to facilitate/maintain the collaboration among clinician collaborators, in a fully decentralized, trustworthy, and flexible way. We conduct several experiments to evaluate HealthFed; in-depth experiments results using public Breast Cancer dataset show the efficiency of HealthFed, by not only ensuring the privacy of each collaborator's sensitive data, but also providing an accurate learning models, which makes HealthFed a promising framework for healthcare systems.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2022.3211192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906419","Healthcare;Federated Learning;B6G;SDN;Blockchain","Medical services;Breast cancer;Data privacy;Blockchains;Computational modeling;Federated learning;Data models","","","","","","","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In particular, security-related services and infrastructures, such as Certificate Authorities (CAs) that provide digital certificate services and Third-Party Authorities (TPAs) that provide cryptographic key services, are critical components for establishing trust in crypto-based privacy-preserving applications and services.

On the one hand, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide advantages such as enabling ground communications also when physical obstacles limit the connectivity. On the other hand, they increase the attack surface. For instance, physical attacks on drones provide the attacker with credentials that can be used to inject bogus information into the IoV network, thus jeopardizing not only security but also users’ safety. In this scenario, authentication plays a fundamental role to guarantee security. It is however fundamental to develop authentication protocols that can, at the same time, protect ground users’ data and prevent attacks to drones. However, currently available authentication schemes cannot guarantee security in case of attacks to drones. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-supported authentication protocol for Drone-assisted IoV using Elliptic curve cryptography (BDIVE). Compared to existing authentication protocols, we extend the threat model from an honest-butcurious drone to active attacks against drones. BDIVE provides both energy-efficiency, traceability, and accountability thanks to the use of blockchain at the Trusted Authority (TA). Using Burrow-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, we analyze and prove the security of mutual authentication in BDIVE. We also prove the security of BDIVE against several attacks by implementing it in AVISPA. To assess its scalability and energy efficiency, we implement BDIVE using Omnetpp with its Castalia simulator. The comparison of BDIVE with currently existing authentication protocols, shows that it reduces the energy consumption up to 70% and the computational cost up to 68%, while providing resistance to previously unconsidered attack vectors.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3217320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9932011","Internet of Vehicles;Drones;Blockchain;Authentication","Drones;Authentication;Security;Blockchains;Protocols;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Costs","","","","","","","IEEE","28 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

With arriving messages, IOTA tangle grows in a special way, as multiple messages can be attached to the tangle at different locations in parallel. Hence, the network dynamics of an operational IOTA system would justify a thorough study, which is currently unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we present the first theoretical modeling for the evolving IOTA tangle based on stochastic analysis. After analyzing snapshots of the real-world IOTA ledger data, our key finding suggests that IOTA tangle follows a rather atypical double Pareto Lognormal (dPLN) degree distribution. In contrast, typical power-law and exponential distributions do not accurately reflect the fact. For model parameter estimation, we further realize that using generic optimization solvers cannot yield quality fitting results. Thus, we design an alternative algorithm based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. We evaluate the proposed model and fitting algorithm with official data provided by IOTA Foundation. Quantitative comparisons confirm the fitting quality of our proposed model and algorithm.

Recently, UAVs have been deployed as aerial base stations in the IIoT network to provide connectivity and share resources with MDs. We consider a resource trading environment where multiple resource providers compete to sell their resources to MDs and maximize their profit by continually adjusting their pricing strategies. Multiple MDs, on the other hand, interact with the environment to make purchasing decisions based on the prices set by resource providers to reduce costs and improve QoS. We propose a novel intelligent resource trading framework that integrates multi-agent deep reinforcement Learning (MADRL), blockchain, and game theory to manage dynamic resource trading environments. A consortium blockchain with a smart contract is deployed to ensure the security and privacy of the resource transactions. We formulated the optimization problem using a Stackelberg game. However, the formulated optimization problem in the multi-agent IIoT environment is complex and dynamic, making it difficult to solve directly.

One of the main difficulties comes from not only how to represent such a general tree with multiple block branches (or sub-chains) related to the multiple mining pools, but also how to analyze a multi-dimensional stochastic system due to the mining competition among the multiple mining pools. In this paper, we first set up a mathematical representation for the tree with multiple block branches. Then we provide a block classification of Ethereum: Regular blocks (in the main chain), orphan blocks, uncle blocks, stale blocks, and nephew blocks, and give some key ratios and probabilities of generating the different types of blocks by applying the law of large numbers. Based on this, we further discuss the growth rate of blockchain and the reward allocation among the multiple mining pools through applying the renewal reward theorem. Finally, we use some simulation experiments to verify our theoretical results, and show that the approximate computation approaches developed, such as the key ratios and probabilities, the long-term growth rate of blockchain, and the long-term reward allocation (rate) among the multiple mining pools, can have a faster convergence. Therefore, we provide a powerful tool for observing and understanding the influence of the selfish mining attacks on the performance of Ethereum with multiple mining pools.

However, the current insurance system is very expensive, as thousands of people pay the premiums, and very few take the claims. Furthermore, the claim settlement process is excruciatingly long and tiresome. In this article, we focus on establishing a rapid and cost-effective framework for the health insurance market, based on machine learning and blockchain technology. By developing a smart contract, blockchain may eliminate any third-party organizations and make the complete process safer, easier, and more efficient. The contract pays the claim based on the claimant’s documentation.

However, it is easy for doctors to modify hospital data to deny incorrect treatment records, which makes it difficult to protect the rights of patients. To improve patient control over EHRs, an attribute-based encryption protection scheme named CEC-ABE for EHRs combined with a blockchain is proposed to protect EHRs in edge cloud environments. In this scheme, the agreement process between the patient and the hospital is completed before the ABE stage, and the treatment information, including the treatment time, treatment doctor and additional information, is confidentially transmitted through an encryption algorithm. By storing the uploaded encrypted data in the blockchain in the form of transaction records, the integrity of the data is guaranteed, which facilitates the traceability of EHR generation. Access to EHRs is controlled by the ABE scheme of the outsourced ciphertext policy, and fine-grained attribute revocation can be employed to ensure the security of the ciphertext. The CEC-ABE algorithm, CP-ABE algorithm and other algorithms are experimentally tested, and the computational cost of each stage of the algorithms and the computational delay of each role are compared. CEC-ABE can significantly improve performance in key generation, outsourced decryption and other stages. Compared with the algorithm whose performance is second only to CEC-ABE, it reduces the computational overhead by 1.73% and 5.2%.

Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. The paper addresses this gap and proposes the Trustworthy Blockchain-enabled system for Indoor Contact Tracing (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed to protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized access.

The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but also quantifies the node’s behavior based on its underlying credit-based mechanism. For achieving high localization performance, we capitalize on availability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures, and develop a data driven localization model based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor measurements.

In this work, we first present an authenticated zero knowledge proof scheme called zk-DASNARK by extending the classical zk-SNARK scheme. Based on zk-DASNARK, we design zk-AuthFeed, a zero-knowledge authenticated off-chain data feed scheme to achieve both data privacy and authenticity for blockchain-based DApps. We fully implement zk-AuthFeed, and conduct comprehensive experiments on a medical insurance DApp. We consider 4 typical computation models for insurance premium/reimbursement in the experiments. It shows that zk-AuthFeed is highly efficient: key generation takes about 10 seconds only, proof generation takes less than 4 seconds, and proof verification takes less than 40 ms.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3153084","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972229); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9720191","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Privacy;Authenticated Data;Zero Knowledge Proof","Smart contracts;Blockchains;Security;Data privacy;Privacy;Zero knowledge proof;Decentralized applications","","","","1","","","IEEE","23 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Numerous efforts have been made to exploit BCT in supporting dynamic and trusted collaborations of business processes. This paper aims to understand recent BCT development for its BPM applications and identify the limitations and challenges for further development via a systematic literature review (SLR). It is found that numerous works have reported using BCT as technical solutions to fulfill some traditional BPM functions. This paper is distinguished from existing works, especially several relevant surveys in the sense that (1) the impact of using BCT in BPM is thoroughly explored to identify new constraints and challenges explicitly brought by blockchains; (2) the requirements for Business Process Compliance (BPC) are firstly analyzed in detail. Note that BPC is to assure the adherence of business processes to pre-defined policies, standards, specifications, regulations, and laws when business processes are executed. To fill the gaps of BCT applications in these two aspects, Blockchain-as-a-Service (BCaaS) is adopted in business process architecture, and the trends of BCT developments are identified accordingly.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3199232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9858637","Business Processes;Business Process Management (BPM);Blockchain Technology (BCT);Smart Contract;Blockchain-as-a-Service (BCaaS);Business Process Compliance (BPC);Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","Business;Collaboration;Adaptation models;Systematics;Bibliographies;Standards organizations;Regulation","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, current approaches are moving away from centralised orchestration towards a decentralised one in order to fully adapt FL for a cross-silo configuration with multiple organisations acting as clients. State-of-the-art decentralised FL mechanisms make at least one of the following assumptions: (a) clients are trusted organisations and cannot inject low quality model updates for aggregation and (b) client local models can be shared with other clients or a third party for verification of low quality updates. This paper proposes a Blockchain based decentralised framework for scenarios where participatory organisations are believed to be fully capable of injecting low quality model updates as they are not willing to expose their local models to any other entity for verification purpose. The proposed decentralised FL framework adopts a novel hierarchical network of aggregators with the ability to punish/reward organisations in proportion to their local model quality updates. The framework is flexible and unlike state-of-the-art solutions, prevents a single entity from possessing the aggregated model in any FL round of training. The proposed framework is tested with respect to off-chain and on-chain performance in two Industry 4.0 use-cases: predictive maintenance and product visual inspection. A comparative evaluation against the state-of-the-art reveals the proposed framework’s utility in terms of minimizing model convergence time and latency while maximizing accuracy and throughput.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3218704","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:13/RC/2077,13/RC/2077_P2,16/RC/3918); H2020 Marie Sk?odowska-Curie Actions(grant numbers:847577); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933813","Federated Learning;Blockchain;Industry 4.0","Data models;Blockchains;Training;Computational modeling;Servers;Predictive models;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-aware transaction scheduling algorithm with defence against DoS attacks based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), namely PTRD. Specifically, considering both the privacy preservation and long-term throughput into the optimization criteria, we formulate the transaction-scheduling problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process. We then design PTRD, which extends off-the-shelf DRL algorithms to constrained optimization with an additional cost critic-network and an adaptive Lagrangian multiplier. Moreover, considering the distribution nature of PCNs, in which each user schedules transactions independently, we develop a distributed training framework to collect the knowledge learned by each agent so as to enhance learning effectiveness. With the customized network design and the distributed training framework, PTRD achieves a good balance between the optimization of the throughput and the minimization of privacy risks. Evaluations show that PTRD outperforms the state-of-the-art PCN routing algorithms by 2.7%–62.5% in terms of the long-term throughput while satisfying privacy constraints.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3216571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927465","Blockchain;deep reinforcement learning;distributed training;privacy-aware;transaction scheduling","Routing;Throughput;Privacy;Optimization;Blockchains;Training;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, reliable P2P delivery demands proper enforcement of delivery fairness, i.e., the deliverers should be rewarded in line with their in-time delivery. Unfortunately, most existing studies on delivery fairness are on the basis of non-cooperative game-theoretic assumptions that are arguably unrealistic in the ad-hoc P2P setting. We propose an expressive yet still minimalist security requirement for desired fair P2P content delivery, and give two efficient blockchain-enabled and monetary-incentivized solutions FairDownload and FairStream for P2P downloading and P2P streaming scenarios, respectively. Our designs not only ensure delivery fairness where deliverers are paid (nearly) proportional to their in-time delivery, but also guarantee exchange fairness where content consumers and content providers are also fairly treated.

However, the intensive computation in the mining process restricts the participation of mobile devices. Currently, some studies have deployed edge computing services to support the mining process, where edge servers managed by one Service Provider (SP) are considered. This paper investigates a more practical scenario with multiple SPs, where servers managed by different SPs have distinct capacities and prices, making miners’ offloading decisions rather complicated. To tackle the above challenges, we consider task offloading, block propagation and miner mobility comprehensively to maximize utilities of miners. Specifically, we first formulate a Markov game, and then design a learning-based offloading algorithm for off-chain computation, where a novel learning model is constructed by integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Mean Field Theory (MFT) to guarantee a Nash equilibrium. Different from existing studies, each miner merely needs to respond to the average effect from others in our system, insteading of knowing policies of others. Finally, both theoritical and performance results show that our designed algorithm has superiority on average miner utilities and algorithm convergence time compared with other representative algorithms.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3186699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808390","Deep reinforcement learning;mean field theory;mobile blockchain;multiple service providers","Blockchains;Servers;Task analysis;Resource management;Markov processes;Games;Computational modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","28 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, IoT nodes are usually resources heterogeneous and subject to malicious attacks, such as the intentional delay of block verification and the transmission of invalid blocks. As a result, a random node-selection model for block transmission may lead to a low transmission rate and serious security risk. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a rate-and-trust-based node selection model for block transmission. In our model, we calculate the block transmission rate of a node by the latency and connectivity among nodes and its trust value by its historical transmission and verification behaviors. On this basis, we propose a PageRank-based optimization algorithm for node selection that makes a tradeoff between the transmission rate and the security risk.

These infrastructures have become a main mechanism in large cities to deal with urban traffic and environmental pollution. A main problem of practical LEZs is that they generally depend on a camera network that identifies users and jeopardizes their privacy. In the literature, there are some privacy-preserving works that rely on camera-free approaches; however, they still suffer from a major issue: they depend on centralized entities to manage the vehicles’ accesses/departures and their corresponding fee payment. Those centralized entities represent a critical single point of failure in the system, endangering its security and availability. In order to address this situation, this paper proposes a new scheme that decentralizes the LEZ management, dealing with vehicle accesses as blockchain transactions, and pricing and charging them using smart contracts. In order to validate the deployability of the new scheme in real scenarios, it has been implemented and tested in both a controlled environment and a low-traffic street.

Byzantine-Fault tolerant consensus assumes restrictive assumptions of time and number of failures to guarantee the validity, while the termination depends on node message broadcasting. Crash-Fault tolerant consensus mechanisms induce lower overhead and faster termination than Byzantine-Fault tolerant mechanisms at the cost of not tolerating malicious behaviors. This paper explores different overlay topologies to assess a lightweight consensus mechanism based on vicinity voting with reliable message broadcasting. The paper proposes different ways to compose the consensus quorum according to the vicinity models. Vicinity models applied in the overlay network allow for relaxing the trade-off between agreement and termination. Analytical and experimental results for different physical topologies show that certain vicinity models guarantee higher number of nodes reached at the time of reaching the consensus threshold (higher than 90% of all nodes) with a lower cost at the exchange of lower fault tolerance.

Unfortunately, existing auditing approaches require owners to undertake expensive tag calculations, which is unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. To resolve the issue, we present a Fair Cloud Auditing proposal by employing the Blockchain (FCAB). We combine certificateless signatures with the designed dynamic structure to constructively offload the cost of tag computation from the IoT device to the introduced fog node, significantly reducing the local burden. Considering that fog nodes may behave dishonestly during auditing, FCAB enables the IoT device to verify the audit result's authenticity by extracting reliable checking records from the blockchain, thereby achieving auditing fairness, which ensures that the honest cloud and fog node will gain the corresponding reward. Finally, FCAB is proved to satisfy tag unforgeability, proof unforgeability, privacy preserving, and auditing fairness. Experiment evaluations affirm that FCAB is computationally and communicationally efficient and retains a smaller and fixed computation locally at the data processing stage (mainly including tag computation) than existing auditing methods.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3207384","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072239,62002167); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BK20211192); Guangxi Key Laboratory of Trusted Software(grant numbers:KX202029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894068","Cloud auditing;Internet of Things;Fog computing;Blockchain;Fairness","Internet of Things;Blockchains;Servers;Cloud computing;Costs;Security;Performance evaluation","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A promising solution to this issue is a payment channel, which allows trust-free payments between two peers without exhausting the resources of the blockchain. A linked payment channel network (PCN) enables payments between two peers through a series of intermediate nodes that forward and charge for the payments. However, most of existing proposals only use the shortest path as the path of the transaction, which causes the frequently reused channels to be exhausted quickly. In addition, most of existing PCNs are almost only designed for payments between two parties, which leads to limited application scenarios. When multiple payments use the same intermediate channel, the two-party PCNs cannot achieve simultaneous payments. In this paper, we propose a multi-party payment channel (MPC) network, a payment channel proposal that supports multiple payments using the same intermediate channel simultaneously, thereby greatly expanding the application scenarios of payment channels. In addition, our channel selection and transaction conversion strategies can also increase the success rate of transactions. We implement MPC network in the simulated blockchain network and lightning network based on Truffle, and a large number of experiments verify the effectiveness of our solution.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3162592","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972296); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210598); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022JQ-618); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745518","Blockchain;smart contract;multi-party;payment channel.","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Games;Bitcoin;Lightning;Topology","","","","1","","","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For this we deploy the IoT micro-Blockchain framework as an atomic-consistency tier and we define a primary set of validity rules that every node can easily carry out. The initial concept relies on Gödel’s Incompleteness theorems and K. Friston’s free energy principle and is investigated under the perspectives of Graph and Game theory. To study the dynamic behavior of the system, a competitive game among the nodes is run. The Proof of Existence is utilized as a universal proofing-case.

Nardelli",NA; NA; NA,"IEEE Network","","2022","PP","99","1","9","Many of the key enabling technologies of the fifthgeneration (5G), such as network slicing, spectrum sharing, and federated learning, rely on a centralized authority. This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single point of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is currently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason, mobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users must perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks require energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT users' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low processing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on commodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing. To do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be treated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity servers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain function virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be performed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe applications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by the BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages of BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show the performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption, transaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.009.2100473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9846939","","Blockchains;Internet of Things;Broadcasting;5G mobile communication;Servers;Task analysis;Computational modeling","","","","1","","","IEEE","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Recent advances in blockchain have significant impacts on securing the transactions in CPSS. Nevertheless, the deployment of blockchain faces fundamental engineering challenges. Specifically, in the remote or disaster areas, users of CPSS typically cannot effectively connect to the blockchain system in real-time due to the deficiency of Internet connection. In the busy urban areas, users are however reluctant to frequently connect to the blockchain system due to the costly communication connection. Thus, the offline blockchain system, which enables direct secured offline transaction channels among users in CPSS and efficiently synchronizes batch transactions to the global blockchain system, is a promising solution to address the problems. This article presents a novel CPSS architecture that can realize the secure transactions for users participating in the offline blockchain transactions by making use of AI based algorithm. We first introduce three typical offline blockchain transaction environments in CPSS, followed by the analysis of the security issues of the proposed architecture. In addition, we present the Hashed Time Locked Contract (HTLC) established for the CPSS users participating in the offline blockchain transaction. To detect the potential malicious attackers in the offline transactions, we introduce an LSTM based RNN model to detect the malicious transaction witness. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of such model.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.111.2100700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852387","","Blockchains;Artificial intelligence;Security;Social networking (online);Computer architecture;Synchronization;Mobile handsets","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Yet they also challenge the conventional implementation of skyline queries because the raw data cannot be shared within the federation and the secure computation cross silos can be two or three orders of magnitude slower than plaintext computation. These constraints render existing solutions inefficient on data federation. In this work, we propose a novel local dominance based framework for efficient skyline queries over a vertical data federation.

However, with an exponential increase in the number of EVs around the globe, it is challenging to assign a unique IP address to each EV for content delivery in V2G environment. Also, with an increase in the number of EVs, the traffic load on the network local area aggregator (LAG), which aggregates the data between Charging Stations (CS) and EVs and disseminates it among different participating entities increases manyfold. Most of the existing solutions reported in literature for the aforementioned problems are based upon traditional Internet Protocol (IP)-based protocol which may have a performance degradation with an increase in the number of nodes in the network. Also, it lacks in-network caching, which is pre-requisite to take efficient decisions for fast content delivery. Hence, to mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose CCN-based secure content delivery scheme for V2G network. Our major contributions in this paper are summarized in three-fold. Firstly, to reduce the load on LAG, we propose in-network caching for fast content delivery in V2G network. Secondly, we propose a contract theory based incentive scheme to attract vehicles to participate in content delivery to the recipients. Thirdly, for secure content delivery and to achieve trust in the network, we propose the proof of authority (PoA) consensus algorithm among vehicles in V2G network.

The intermediate decryption-encryption problem, however, is considered as the security threat of such schemes. Multi-path algorithms have been proposed to face such a shortcoming. Alas, these solutions are vulnerable against the node capture attack, where the attacker compromises a fraction of network nodes. In this paper, we propose BlocKP, a Blockchain-based solution to increase the resistance of the network against the node capture attack. BlocKP utilizes disjoint key-paths for a key exchange process, where the keying materials form a block at the source-side. Each key-path step generates the next block of the Blockchain until the keying materials reach the destination. BlocKP is a general framework applicable to any key pre-distribution schemes. We propose BlocKP in two versions BlocKP-I and BlocKP-II, where the latter enhance the resistance of BlocKP-I using erasure codes at the cost of negligible control traffic. We analytically show that BlocKP improves the resistance of the network against the node capture attack to almost perfect resistance, using just a small number of paths. We evaluate our solution by performing extensive simulations, considering three baseline key pre-distribution schemes, including probabilistic asymmetric key pre-distribution (PAKP), strong Steiner trade (SST), and unital key pre-distribution (UKP). We equipped these schemes with a compatible multi-path algorithm to offer end-to-end security. Results show that BlocKP improves the throughput up to 5% and decreases the flow completion time into 20% compared to baseline schemes. It has comparable routing traffic, latency, and throughput with augmented solutions but up to 60% improvement in the resistance against the node capture attack.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3137900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9662083","Secure end-to-end communication;multi-hop wireless network;key pre-distribution;Blockchain.","Resistance;Cryptography;Security;Blockchains;Faces;Wireless networks;Throughput","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Liu",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"IEEE Network","","2022","PP","99","1","9","Data sharing is essential for future autonomous vehicles in vehicular networks. Building trust in the shared data can be challenging among mutually unknown vehicles in an open and distributed environment. Blockchain is the key to establish trusted data sharing in a decentralized vehicular environment. However, the low efficiency (e.g., transaction per second, TPS) of blockchain is the bottleneck for the efficient data sharing. Moreover, the highly dynamic topology, the imperfect wireless links, and the limited radio coverage may further slow down the blockchain consensus process. To improve the efficiency and trustworthiness of data sharing in a vehicular network, we propose a sharding-enabled vehicular blockchain system. Specifically, the blockchain-enabled vehicles are dynamically allocated to different shards based on their geographical locations so that transactions are processed in parallel. We design an efficient and trusted sharding-enabled blockchain consensus mechanism by integrating a reputation-assisted intrashard consensus and a vehicle-assisted inter-shard consensus. The reputation assistance in intra-shard consensus is designed to defend against the collusive false-block attack that may happen in a small-scale shard environment.

Such a service aims to support safe navigation while optimizing ships' trajectories. However, to deploy it, timely and accurate prediction of ships' positioning with real-time reactions is needed to anticipate collisions. In such a context, ships positions are usually predicted using advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Traditionally, ML schemes require that the data be processed in a centralized way, e.g., a cloud data center managed by a third party. However, these schemes are not suitable for the collisions avoidance service due to the inaccessibility of ships' positioning data by this third party, and allowing connected ships to get access to sensitive information. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new cooperative collision avoidance system for inland ships, while ensuring data security and privacy. Our system is based on deep federated learning to collaboratively build a model of ship positioning prediction, while avoiding sharing their private data. In addition, it is deployed at multi-access edge computing (MEC) level to provide low-latency communication to ensure fast responses during collision detection. Furthermore, it relies on Blockchain and smart contracts to ensure trust and valid communications between ships and MEC nodes. We evaluate the proposed system using a generated dataset representing ships mobility in France. The results, which demonstrate the accuracy of our prediction model, prove the effectiveness of our cooperative collision avoidance system in ensuring timely and reliable communications and avoiding collisions between ships.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3154158","Universite Bourgogne Franche Comté France; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9729800","Water transportation systems;internet of ships;cooperative collision avoidance;deep federated learning;mobile edge computing;consortium blockchain.","Marine vehicles;Collision avoidance;Rivers;Blockchains;Navigation;Computer architecture;Real-time systems","","","","1","","","IEEE","8 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we design and implement an access authentication scheme to simultaneously and efficiently provide anonymity and accountability without relying on any trusted third party by utilizing a permissionless blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) and Intel SGX. Inspired by the recent progress on Bitcoin techniques such as Colored Coins, we utilize the unmodified Bitcoin blockchain as the powerful platform to manage access credentials without introducing any trusted third party. We leverage SGX-based mixer to allow users to anonymously exchange their access credentials and design the verification path of access credentials to support blacklisting misbehaving access credentials without compromising users' anonymity. By integrating with the anti-double-spending property of the Bitcoin blockchain, our scheme can simultaneously provide users' accountability and anonymity without involving any trusted third party. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme is compatible with the current Bitcoin system or other permissionless blockchains, and is highly effective and practical for public Wi-Fi hotspot access control systems.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3218528","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62072426,61871362,U19B2023,U21B2026); Key Research and Development Program of Anhui(grant numbers:202104b11020029); Innovation and Application Demonstration of Social Management Information Technology of Hainan Free Trade Port(grant numbers:ZDKJ2019008); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2047484,CNS-2211214); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933874","","Authentication;Blockchains;Wireless fidelity;Bitcoin;Blocklists;Encryption;Protocols","","","","","","","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper thus carried out a performance analysis of the blockchain-enabled data-sharing framework from latency and data age perspectives to investigate the suitability of blockchain technology in data sharing systems. To achieve this, the uniqueness of such systems such as transactions validation latency, transaction generation rate, waiting time, blockchain-appending rate, and overall communication latency were jointly studied. The communication latency was characterized following the spatiotemporal modeling approach. We further adopted the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol due to its well discussed suitability in large-scale data sharing applications and captured the validation stages of such a PBFT scheme using the Erlang distribution of order $k$. Simulations results show that various influential system parameters must be carefully considered when adopting blockchain technology in time-sensitive data sharing applications.

Motivated by the recent progress of utilizing Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to protect account privacy in cryptocurrencies, this article systematically investigates a ZKPbased privacy-enhancing BIAC architecture. We summarize the design principles as authenticating transactions with ZKP proofs instead of digital signatures so that permissions are linked to off-chain secrets rather than on-chain accounts. However, since the ZKP proofs are stored on the blockchain, an adversary may launch replay attacks to access resources illegally. To tackle this challenge, we carefully design two account-hiding transactions as well as validation rules for the classical capability-based AC (CBAC) model, where all ZKP proofs expire once used. The enhanced system preserves all necessary functions of CBAC while achieving permission invisibility and requester anonymity. We implement the designed ZKP operations, where the evaluation results demonstrate our solution incurs low overheads.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.126.2200334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903388","","Blockchains;Internet of Things;Privacy;Permission;Access control;Zero knowledge proof;Cryptocurrency","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Insiders are legitimate vehicles who have passed the registration process. Since they can exploit all the information related to the network and other members’ communication, it is easier to perform various attacks with a high impact. In addition, an authority takes charge of registering and managing legitimate vehicles. Thus, if the authority is compromised, it will cause significant damage to the system, including the leaking of private information, such as identity, location, and membership. Many authentication schemes have been proposed to protect vehicular communication from these security issues. However, most existing schemes still face the vulnerability of malicious members. Furthermore, most conventional schemes require additional interactions between vehicles and infrastructure for authentication, which can cause communication overheads. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel blockchain-based one-time authentication scheme to protect vehicular communication against malicious members. One-time authentication provides higher security and efficiency as every message is authenticated with different proof at a time. We use publicly verifiable secret sharing with blockchain for this property, which brings two benefits. First, it prevents even an authority from obtaining members’ identities by distributing encrypted shares instead of their real identities. Second, it enables robust vehicular communication against insiders’ attacks by allowing a vehicle to send unique proof generated from its private information with messages. Receivers can authenticate the messages by comparing attached values to the information through the blockchain in a non-interactive manner. Security analysis shows that our scheme assures secure V2X communication against insider attacks, and efficiency analysis shows how both authentication and consensus delay change.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3224465","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion(grant numbers:2021-0-00368,2022-0-00704); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1D1A1B07049043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9963786","Security and Privacy;Secure Communications;Vehicular Networks","Authentication;Blockchains;Vehicle-to-everything;Security;Privacy;Receivers;Internet of Things","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the usability of smart contracts is constrained to the data on the blockchain, and has no direct access to the off-chain environment. Consequently, smart contract cannot directly serve as a carrier for the IIoT applications that rely on intensive data exchange and task computation. To cope with this issue, we first propose an oracle-aided IIoT blockchain (OIB) system to facilitate the deployment of smart contract based IIoT applications. Specifically, a distributed oracle network is employed to not only bridge the off-chain environment and smart contracts, but also extend the computing capability of smart contracts. Then, we study important properties of the OIB system, i.e., liveness, safety, and fairness. In particular, we propose a new challenge of fairness to guarantee that each oracle can reap positive utility (i.e., individual rationality), and a new challenge of liveness to meet delay constraints of oracle services (i.e., delay-sensitivity). To address these two challenges, we develop an auction based incentive mechanism for the data-feeding oracles to achieve individual rationality as well as incentive compatibility, and a delay-sensitive matching based incentive mechanism for the computing oracles under specific delay constraints. Simulation results corroborate that the proposed auction based incentive mechanism guarantees not only truthfulness but also individual rationality, and show that the matching based incentive mechanism achieves smaller delay than the random selection scheme used in the Decentralized Oracle Service (DOS) network.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.103.2100395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852384","","Industrial Internet of Things;Blockchains;Smart contracts;Task analysis;Delays;Smart devices;Data centers","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Furthermore, to consider energy management from an economic viewpoint, we address the attack issue by proposing a robust energy trading (RET) algorithm. The proposed system demonstrates high robustness to malicious attacks. Our experimental results show that the RET reduces 30% energy loss when 20% of consumers are attacked. Moreover, malicious exchanges are excluded progressively from the trading market during each trading round.

One such instrument is a Contract-for-Difference (CFD), usually available to renewable generators in certain electricity markets to enable them to hedge their price risk. Embracing CFD presents new risks such as counterparty credit, margining, third-party, legal, and process risks. Derivative instruments existing on blockchains have recently demonstrated potential as suitable hedging tools for minimizing the risks of renewable generators. The present manuscript applies this concept for the first time to hedge the price risk of renewable generators by implementing a novel decentralized finance instrument, an Ethereum blockchain marketplace governed by a smart contract to mediate between stakeholders mutually enrolled in bilateral CFD arrangements. The employed structure mitigates the underlying risks of traditional arrangements, underpinned by a suite of autonomous mechanisms.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3185661","Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland under the SEAI Research, Development &amp; Demonstration Funding Programme 2018(grant numbers:18/RDD/373); UCD Energy Institute; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804842","","Smart contracts;Generators;Instruments;Blockchains;Renewable energy sources;Electricity supply industry;Security","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The traditional system of storing and auditing claims is centralized to the corresponding organizations. As the centralized auditing system does not allow the integration of the claims among different insurance organizations, an individual policyholder or a service provider may submit claims to more than one insurance organization to get multiple benefits. Multiple benefits can be avoided by collaborating with the authority of different organizations. However, collaborating different organizations raise the privacy and security concerns. Hence, in this paper, we propose a Quorum based Federated Blockchain Network (QFBC), a privacy-preserving decentralized system to integrate health insurance claims of different organizations in a secure manner. The performance of the proposed QFBN framework in avoiding multiple benefits and providing privacy and security which is analyzed in terms of Security Incidents (SI), Mean Time To Detect (MTTD), and Mean Time For Vendors Incident Response (MTFVIR) are compared with the decentralized frameworks that developed for detecting healthcare frauds using blockchain. Based on the empirical results, it is observed that the QFBN framework provided an environment with better security for exchanging healthcare information.","2162-2256","","10.1109/MCE.2022.3188880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816098","","Medical services;Organizations;Blockchains;Insurance;Security;Data breach;Collaboration","","","","","","","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we explore the potential of redactable blockchain and propose a privacy-preserving dynamic searchable encryption framework (DSE-RB), which is a general scheme that guarantees reliable queries and updates on encrypted data. In particular, we first use transaction-level editing technology to achieve a more flexible update operation of encrypted data without additional transactions while avoiding the waste of storage on the chain.

However, malicious attackers may impersonate other vehicles to propagate forged traffic/road information. Therefore, authentication schemes based on the blockchain were proposed to check the legitimacy of vehicles. At first glance, these proposals can effectively accomplish the authentication process using smart contracts. However, these schemes have poor scalability. Specifically, with the certificate update and the number of revoked certificates growing, the blockchain state database storage continues to increase, which consumes additional computation and storage resources and affects the execution efficiency of smart contracts. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues by proposing a consortium blockchain-based source authentication scheme for road condition monitoring(ACRoM). In ACRoM, the traffic report is uploaded to the regional trusted authority(RTA) together with one transaction constructed based on the unspent transaction output(UTXO) model. The transaction is utilized to accomplish the source authentication process, which is achieved by verifying the legality of each input contained in the transaction. Moreover, based on the UTXO model, we propose a transaction update mechanism to keep the database storage curve at dynamic stability rather than unlimited growth, which guarantees the scalability of ACRoM. The simulations show that the retrieval time remains at about 0.28ms while the storage cost is stable at about 29.46M for the blockchain state database. Besides, benefiting from the efficient batch-verification mechanism, the computation cost of source authentication is about 0.362ms on average, which outperforms the existing state-of-art schemes.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3229410","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902157,62272203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991057","Traffic condition monitoring;blockchain;source authentication;transaction","","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contract for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with expert patterns to yield a final detection system.

Then, EXGEN generates symbolic attack contracts with transactions in a partial order and then symbolically executes the attack contracts together with the target to find and solve all the constraints. Lastly, EXGEN concretizes all the symbols, generates attack contracts with multiple transactions, and verifies the generated contracts' exploitability on a private chain with values crawled from the public chain. We implemented a prototype of EXGEN and evaluated it on Ethereum and EOS benchmarks. EXGEN successfully exploits 1,258/1,399 (89.9%) Ethereum and 126/130 (96.9%) EOS vulnerabilities.

Obviously, these schemes are unsuitable for IoT devices due to the limited computational and communication resources. In this work, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving federated learning scheme for IoT devices. To protect the privacy of individual local data, we add masks to intervening parameters. An effective secret sharing scheme is adopted to ensure that masks can be eliminated accurately. Considering that FedL involves multiple iterations and mask generation for each iteration costs a large number of interactions among users for privacy guarantee, we also design a secure mask reusing mechanism for large-scale FedL tasks. We prove that our scheme is secure against the honest-but-curious model. In addition, we also expand our scheme to deal with the collusion attack.

We argue that our MGFNAS framework is general in the sense that it does not impose any restriction on the search space or strategy, such that most existing neural architecture search techniques can be readily implemented in.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3116248","National Key Project of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072127,62002075,62002076); Project 6142111180404 supported by CNKLSTISS Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou China(grant numbers:202002030131); Guangdong basic and applied basic research fund joint fund Youth Fund(grant numbers:2019A1515110213); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682658); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552481","Machine Learning;Privacy Protection;Federated Learning;Neural Architecture Search;Edge Computing","Computer architecture;Servers;Data models;Computational modeling;Search problems;Network architecture;Data privacy","","","","1","","","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Recent works adopt knowledge distillation to amalgamate the knowledge of learned features and predictions from heterogeneous on-device models to realize HMA. However, most of them ignore that the disclosure of learned features exposes on-device models to privacy attacks. Moreover, the aggregated model may suffer from the imbalanced supervision caused by the uneven distribution of amalgamated knowledge about each class and show class bias. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a response-based class-balanced heterogeneous model aggregation mechanism, called CBHMA. It can effectively achieve HMA in a privacy-preserving manner and alleviate class bias in the aggregated model. Specifically, CBHMA aggregates on-device models by using only their response information to reduce their privacy leakage risk. To mitigate the impact of imbalanced supervision, CBHMA quantitatively measures the imbalanced supervision level for each class. Based on that, CBHMA customizes fine-grained misclassification costs for each class and utilizes such costs to adjust the importance of each class (more importance to classes with weaker supervision) in the response-based HMA algorithm. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CBHMA.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3183170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796594","","Computational modeling;Training;Privacy;Data models;Costs;Training data;Task analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this work, we aim to propose a novel Decoupled Adversarial Policy (DAP) for attacking the DRL mechanism, whereas the adversarial agent can decompose the adversarial policy into two separate sub-policies: 1) the switch policy which determines if an attacker should launch the attack, and 2) the lure policy which determines the action an attacker induces the victim to take. If the adversarial agent samples an injection action from the switch policy, the attacker can query the pre-constructed database for universal perturbation in the real-time manner, misleading the victim to take the induced action sampled from the lure policy. To train the adversarial agent to learn DAP, we utilize those samples wherein both of the sub-actions from DAP are not restricted by each other or by the external constraint, but can actually affect the attackers behaviors. Therefore, we propose trajectory clipping and padding in data pruning, and Decoupled Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO) in optimizing.

Additionally, SAZyzz reduces the communication complexity to O(logN) in two paths of the protocol. However, the tree-based topology has been argued that has a shortcoming when used in designing BFT consensus protocols. This refers to the strong assumption that all the internal nodes of the tree are honest, which leads to a trade-off between tolerating Byzantine faults and better performance and scalability.

Although cross-chain technology just started, the cross-chain technology and its applications are gradually improving to meet the development needs of blockchain system. At the same time, they have already realized asset transfers across heterogeneous blockchains and platforms, and some projects have realized cross-chain information exchange. At present, cross-chain technology includes the following typical methods: Hash-locking, Notary scheme, Distributed private key control, Sidechains/Relays and Tight coupling. This paper analyzes the above methods from the aspect of techniques, security requirements, and technical limitation, and compares their applicability. With public blockchains and consortium blockchains, this paper analyzes their problems and challenges in cross-chain technology and introduces the main approaches of existing solutions. By analyzing the existing cross-chain technologies and problems, this paper further introduces eight popular cross-chain projects and their application prospects. Finally, this paper summarizes and proposes the future research topics and development trends of cross-chain technology.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3228535","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072082); National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:21&ZD124); Key Research and Development Program of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2020JH2/10100037); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N2216005,N2216008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982450","Blockchain;Cross-chain Transaction;Information Transfer;Interoperability","Blockchains;Security;Process control;Costs;Sharding;Couplings;Computer architecture","","","","","","","CCBY","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for training a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security challenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from malicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which will degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this paper, we shall propose a decentralized blockchain based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep reinforcement learning based algorithm to provide high system performance with low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can resist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training latency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by deep reinforcement learning based algorithm compared with baseline algorithms.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3201117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9866512","Trustworthy AI;federated learning;blockchain;long-term latency minimization;resource allocation","Servers;Artificial intelligence;Training;Resource management;Consensus protocol;Wireless communication;Computational modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, most sharding systems leverage a non-cooperative design, which lowers the fault tolerance resilience due to the decreased mining power as the consensus execution is limited to each separated shard. To this end, we present Benzene, a novel sharding system that enhances the performance by cooperation-based sharding while defending the per-shard security. Firstly, we establish a double-chain architecture for function decoupling. This architecture separates transaction-recording functions from consensus-execution functions, thereby enabling the cross-shard cooperation during consensus execution while preserving the concurrency nature of sharding. Secondly, we design a cross-shard block verification mechanism leveraging Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), via which miners can verify blocks from other shards during the cooperation process with the minimized overheads. Finally, we design a voting-based consensus protocol for cross-shard cooperation. Transactions in each shard are confirmed by all shards that simultaneously cast votes, consequently achieving an enhanced fault tolerance and lowering the confirmation latency. We implement Benzene and conduct both prototype experiments and large-scale simulations to evaluate the performance of Benzene. Results show that Benzene achieves superior performance than existing sharding/non-sharding blockchain protocols. In particular, Benzene achieves a linearly-improved throughput with the increased number of shards (e.g., 32,370 transactions per second with 50 shards) and maintains a lower confirmation latency than Bitcoin (with more than 50 shards). Meanwhile, Benzene maintains a fixed fault tolerance at 1/3 even with the increased number of shards.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2022.3227198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983501","Blockchain;sharding;scalability;function decoupling;consensus algorithm","Sharding;Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance;Security;Throughput;Protocols;Bitcoin","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A critical challenge in the data sharing process is ensuring that the data is high quality. However, the quality of data provided by a large number of IoT devices is impacted by the variability of factors contributing to the data quality (DQ). Effective and safe sharing of perception data by the limited resources of IoT devices is a problem worth investigating. In this article, we propose a smart contract–based and DQ-driven incentive mechanism. First, a smart contract is proposed to realize security in the data-sharing process, while the proposed DQ evaluation mechanism ensures the quality of the shared data. Second, a two-layer Stackelberg game of Nested Coalitional(TLSNC) scheme is designed to obtain the maximum overall social welfare according to the trust score obtained during DQ evaluation while satisfying the limitation of loose and insufficient computing resources. Moreover, we designed a smart contract for automatic execution of the data-sharing transaction and used a trusted execution environment (TEE) to complete the security calculation of shared data. Finally, the numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the DQ evaluation mechanism and the security of our TEE-based model. Based on the proposed scheme, sustainable incentives for user participation and high-quality data sharing can be achieved.

In this paper, to explore the data characteristics of the Bitcoin blockchain, we performed a comprehensive statistical experiment on the current 680,000 blocks. The analysis results indicated that in nearly 95% of blocks, the number of spent transaction output (STXO) accounts for more than 67% of the total transaction outputs. Inspired by this feature, we proposed a novel storage scheme to reduce the size of blocks by deleting the transaction data with the STXO ratio over 67% first and compressing fixed-length fields of those transactions. Then, the newly generated block files were deposited to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) private network to improve the scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain.

In contrast to security mechanisms running separately in centralized servers that do not trust each other, our framework achieves consistent consensus on photo dissemination control through carefully designed smart contract-based protocols. We use these protocols to create platform-free dissemination trees for every image, providing users with complete sharing control and privacy protection. Considering the possible privacy conflicts between owners and subsequent re-posters in cross-SNP sharing, we design a dynamic privacy policy generation algorithm that maximizes the flexibility of re-posters without violating formers' privacy. Moreover, Go-sharing also provides robust photo ownership identification mechanisms to avoid illegal reprinting. It introduces a random noise black box in a two-stage separable deep learning process to improve robustness against unpredictable manipulations. Through extensive real-world simulations, the results demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the framework across a number of performance metrics.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3208934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9901505","photo sharing;privacy-preserving;cross-SNP;blockchain","Privacy;Security;Watermarking;Social networking (online);Heuristic algorithms;Sun;Robustness","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

So far, the auction match is the main strategy for allocating resources, in which there exists a trusted third party playing a role as a broker to deal with resource allocation requests for both providers and consumers. The main concerns in resource allocation architecture are how and how long to solve the Winner Determination Problem (WDP), which is used to lay out the match outcome. It is not easy for a single broker with limited computing power to generate an optimal solution in a short period since its corresponding time complexity is regarded as the NP-hard problem. Meanwhile, it is hard for people to trust the third party thoroughly. That is, there are three potential issues, including centralization, data security, and untrustworthiness in traditional matching architecture.

In this article, we propose a plastic credit driven system consisting of a recyclability index (RI) and plastic credit to impel plastic recycling and increase the quality of recyclable plastics through a market self-regulation mechanism. The RI is designed to evaluate the recyclability value of different plastic products based on their material compositions. The plastic credit, defined by the quantitative relation between the RI and product information, can be issued or traded by system stakeholders. Instead of setting rigid industry standards to regulate plastic quality, we construct a governance community among industry participants using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to self-regulate and monitor plastic production and trading. The proposed system is constructed on a consortium blockchain and a public blockchain to negotiate the RI, issue credits, and trade credits using smart contracts. Through the overall system performance analysis, the experimental results demonstrate that the designed plastic credit system can promote a demand shift toward plastic products with higher plastic recyclability and achieve a lightweight operation for resource requirements and system maintenance.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2022.3205266","University College of London/Engineering; Physical Sciences Research Council Plastic Waste Innovation Hub; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9911190","Blockchain;plastic waste;recycling management;smart contract","Plastics;Recycling;Blockchains;Plastic products;Smart contracts;Companies;Carbon dioxide","","","","","","","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Transparent and Tamper-Proof Event Ordering in the Internet of Things Platforms","M. Rahman; A.

The current IoT platforms lack techniques for transparent and tamper-proof ordering of events due to their device-centric logging mechanism. In this paper, we develop a framework that facilitates tamper-proof transparency and event order in an IoT platform by proposing a Blockchain protocol and adopting the vector clock system, both tailored for the resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT devices, respectively. To cope with the unsuited storage (e.g., ledger) and computing power (e.g., proof of work puzzle) requirements of the Blockchain in the commercial off-the-shelf IoT devices, we propose a partial consistent cut protocol and engineer a modular arithmetic-based lightweight proof of work puzzle, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Blockchain designed for resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT platforms. Our event ordering protocol based on the vector clock system is also novel for the IoT platforms. We implement our framework using an IoT gateway and 30 IoT devices. We experiment with 10 concurrent trigger-action-based event chains while each chain involves 20 devices, and each device participates in 5 different chains. The results show that our framework may order these events in 2.5 seconds while consuming approximately 140 mJ of energy per device. The results hence demonstrate the proposed platform as a practical choice for many IoT applications such as smart home, traffic monitoring, and crime investigation.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3222450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953112","Internet of Things;wireless network;blockchain;event order","Internet of Things;Protocols;Logic gates;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Monitoring;Bitcoin","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Considering that some basic data will be owned by the market entities, the computation of evaluation indices may require shared data from multiple parties. However, for the sake of privacy, the market entities may be reluctant to share their data. To address the above issues, a novel computation scheme of evaluation indices of SES market in the renewable energy accommodation scenario is proposed based on smart contracts with the key advantages of decentralization and data privacy protection. Firstly, a power blockchain-based information disclosure framework of SES market is presented to confirm the data ownership of the market entities. Moreover, a decentralized computation scheme combined with smart contracts and fully homomorphic encryption is proposed to compute the evaluation indices of SES market without exposing the original values of the shared data, preserving the privacy of data sharers, i.e., the market entities of SES market. Finally, case studies on the actual data from an SES trading pilot project in Qinghai, China, are performed to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheme based on a Hyperledger Fabric-based simulation system of power blockchain.

Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable, thus, defects in the deployed code cannot be fixed. As a consequence, software engineering anti-patterns, such as code cloning, pose a threat to code quality and security if unnoticed before deployment. In this paper, we report on the cloning practices of the Ethereum blockchain platform by analyzing 33,073 smart contracts amounting to over 4MLOC. Prior work reported an unusually high 79.2% of code clones in Ethereum smart contracts. We replicate this study at the conceptual level, i.e., we answer the same research questions by employing different methods. In particular, we analyze clones at the granularity of functions instead of code files, thereby providing a more fine-grained estimate of the clone ratio. Furthermore, we analyze more complex clone types, allowing for a richer analysis of cloning cases. To achieve this finer granularity of cloning analysis, we rely on the NiCad clone detection tool and extend it with support for Solidity, the programming language of the Ethereum platform. Our analysis shows that most findings of the original study hold at the finer granularity of our study as well; but also sheds light on some differences, and contributes new findings. Most notably, we report a 30.13% overall clone ratio, out of which 27.03% are exact duplicates. Our findings motivate improving the reuse mechanisms of Solidity, and in a broader context, of programming languages used for the development of smart contracts. Tool builders and language engineers can use this paper in the design and development of such reuse mechanisms. Business stakeholders can use this paper to better assess the security risks and technical outlooks of blockchain platforms.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3207428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894714","Blockchain;code cloning;empirical study;ethereum;smart contracts","Cloning;Codes;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Computer languages;Syntactics","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme with on-chain certificate management (PACM) in VANETs, where the service manager (SM) of each domain serves as a node of the blockchain to build a distributed system. Specifically, based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and exclusive-OR operations, we achieve secure and lightweight mutual authentication between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) by regularly updated pseudonyms. Then, we adopt the blockchain to record the issuance and revocation of all certificates, which makes SM’s activities transparent. Moreover, we introduce the counting garbled bloom filter (CGBF) to enable fast query and revocation of certificates. Besides, we design a non-forgeable and non-repudiable billing mechanism based on the hash chain technology. Security analysis and experimental results show that PACM achieves stronger security with less overhead.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3201551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9866882","VANETs;Blockchain;Authentication;Privacy protection;Certificate management","Authentication;Blockchains;Privacy;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Public key;Scalability;Receivers","","","","1","","","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To solve these problems, we propose a Spatiotemporal Prediction based Spatial Crowdsourcing strategy, named SPSC, using both blockchain and artificial intelligence. Specifically, considering the temporal and spatial continuity of crowdsourced task data, SPSC combines both gated recurrent unit and variational autoencoder for crowdsourcing task prediction. In addition, different Laplacian noises are added to crowdsourced task data so as to protect the privacy of crowdsourced workers during the task prediction. Moreover, by classifying crowdsourcing tasks and grouping crowdsourcing workers, SPSC reduces the risk of crowdsourcing workers colluding to steal the privacy data of crowdsourcing tasks using the blockchain technology. The experimental results show that SPSC can improve the privacy protection of spatial crowdsourcing, specifically, the more the number of categories, the higher the degree of privacy protection, and under the premise of predicting value, excellent system performance can be achieved.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2022.3198675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857623","Spatial Crowdsourcing;Task Allocation;Privacy Protection;Blockchain;Machine Learning","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Resource management;Privacy;Ions;Blockchains;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In the current NFT system, owner’s address of each NFT is stored in plaintext. This leads to a severe privacy problem: once a person’s blockchain address is known, all his NFT assets are viewable, which may further cause problems related to the privacy of holding sensitive NFT or premeditated scams to high-value NFT owners. However, due to the limitation of Ethereum and smart contract, it is hard to prevent others from tracking the owner of NFT. Meanwhile, current state-of-the-art NFT research usually assumes the relation between blockchain address and owner’s identity is unknown, thus creating the so-called anonymity. In this paper, based on the most popular NFT marketplace OpenSea’s system, we propose a new exchange scheme to hides the address of NFT owner during trading. To achieve our goal, a proof of commitment scheme is exploited to bind the owner to an NFT while hiding the identity. Moreover, An anonymous payment method is designed to prevent attackers from tracing the Ether flow in NFT trading. Our scheme is proven to be secure against curious users and malicious active attackers. Implementation on testnet also shows that the increased gas cost is acceptable, meaning it is suitable for application.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3228787","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP22H03588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982643","Non-Fungible Token;owner privacy;blockchain;security","Nonfungible tokens;Privacy;Smart contracts;Distributed ledger;Bitcoin;Blockchains;Metadata;Security","","","","","","","CCBY","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper aims to fill this key knowledge gap using an experimental testbed of twelve full nodes connected to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. With the aid of novel logging tools, we contrast the performance of these three protocols, in realistic scenarios, with respect to communication, delay, and block decoding success. Our main findings are that Graphene generally performs the best when nodes remain connected, boasting an average propagation delay of 190 ms (i.e. 29% lower than compact block and 80% lower than the legacy protocol). However, when nodes churn at a high rate, compact blocks may perform better.

Furthermore, image sequences of the same finger acquired from different views usually show significant differences. As a result, the existing works are still sensitive to positional variations of the fingers, specifically those caused by finger roll movements. 2) Using multiple cameras can lead to increased costs. Moreover, it is impossible to employ several cameras to acquire full-view images because of the limited space on capturing devices. To address the above issues, we present FV-LT, a Full-View Finger-Vein identification system based on a Local attention Transformer, by implementing an image acquisition device with a single camera. First, we design and implement a finger-vein acquisition prototype device that utilizes a single camera and a LED group to rotate along a finger for full-view image collection. This allows capturing all vein patterns concealed beneath human skin to form a complete representation of finger features. Second, given the full-view vein images, we propose a local attention transformer-based approach to extract dependency features of a token (a patch or an image) on its neighborhood’s tokens among image patches and among full-view images, respectively. These dependency features are shown to be robust to positional variations induced by finger rolls. Based on the public database of full-view finger-vein images captured by our designed device, we verify the performance of the proposed FV-LT. The experimental results show that FV-LT significantly outperforms existing 2D/multi-view based approaches with respect to improving the tolerance against finger roll and achieving the state-of-the-art identification accuracy.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3227385","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976030 and 62072061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973408","Multi-view vein identification;Full-view finger-vein images;Transformer;Deep learning","Veins;Fingers;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Face recognition;Deep learning","","","","","","","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Since video clips distributed on networks are usually untrimmed, it is required to accurately segment a given untrimmed video into a set of action segments for HAR. As an unsupervised temporal segmentation technology, subspace clustering learns the codes from each video to construct an affinity graph, and then cuts the affinity graph to cluster the video into a set of action segments. However, most of the existing subspace clustering schemes not only ignore the sequential information of frames in code learning, but also the negative effects of noises when cutting the affinity graph, which lead to inferior performance. To address these issues, we propose a sequential order-aware coding-based robust subspace clustering (SOAC-RSC) scheme for HAR. By feeding the motion features of video frames into multi-layer neural networks, two expressive code matrices are learned in a sequential order-aware manner from unconstrained and constrained videos, respectively, to construct the corresponding affinity graphs. Then, with the consideration of the existence of noise effects, a simple yet robust cutting algorithm is proposed to cut the constructed affinity graphs to accurately obtain the action segments for HAR. The extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SOAC-RSC scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the datasets of Keck Gesture and Weizmann, and provides competitive performance on the other 6 public datasets such as UCF101 and URADL for HAR task, compared to the recent related approaches.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2022.3224877","National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant for Joint Fund Project(grant numbers:U1936218); National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant for Outstanding Youth Foundation(grant numbers:61722203); National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant(grant numbers:61972205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9969664","Action clustering;action recognition;unsupervised learning;code learning;untrimmed video","Videos;Codes;Feature extraction;Motion segmentation;Clustering algorithms;Task analysis;Image coding","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, it brings ethical and legal issues of data privacy at the same time. In this paper, we study the problem of aggregating individual's preference data in the local differential privacy (LDP) setting. One naive approach is to add Laplace random noises, which however suffers from low statistical utility and is fragile to LDP-specific poisoning attacks. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism to improve the utility and the robustness simultaneously: the additive mechanism. The additive mechanism randomly outputs a subset of candidates with a probability proportional to their total scores. For preference data with Borda rule over $d$ items, its mean squared error bound is optimized from $O(\frac{d^{5}}{n\epsilon ^{2}})$ to $O(\frac{d^{4}}{n\epsilon ^{2}})$, and its maximum poisoning risk bound is reduced from $+\infty$ to $O(\frac{d^{2}}{n\epsilon })$. We also theoretically investigate minimax lower bounds of $\epsilon$-LDP preference data aggregation, and prove the error rate of $O(\frac{d^{4}}{n\epsilon ^{2}})$ is optimal for the Borda rule. Experimental results validate that our proposed approaches averagely reduce estimation error by 50% and are more robust to adversarial poisoning attacks.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2022.3207486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894703","Data aggregation;data poisoning;differential privacy;local privacy;minimax error;preference data","Data aggregation;Robustness;Videos;Privacy;Measurement;Differential privacy;Additives","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For example, several recent news items show that a considerable number of registered drivers whose licenses have been revoked are still taking RHS orders on the respective platforms; this phenomenon directly leads to insecurity on part of its users and the bad reputation of the ride-hailing service provider(SP). The traditional solution to solve this problem is to periodically check the validity of the drivers' licenses; however, it is a considerably time-consuming and costly process since the SPs have to manually interact with the governing authorities. Therefore, in this paper, we have presented an auditable self-sovereign identity system (named AudiSSI), which provides an efficient approach for the SPs to manage their registered drivers' qualifications in a decentralized and automatic manner. Further, we propose a safety guarantee insurance to enable the RHS rider to check their driver's qualifications before the trip starts.

To solve the problem, this paper designs a multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model to calculate the service quality parameters of the network slicing. The calculated service quality parameters can be used as an adjustment basis in the negotiation of the SLA between the customer and the network operator. However, the traditional method of calculating information across chains will cause frequent information interactions and affect efficiency. Therefore, in this scheme, we deploy a smart contract on each blockchain to calculate the information, which can reduce the frequency of information transmission and improve efficiency. In addition, in order to make the calculation between smart contracts more fluent and the requirements more relevant, this paper proposes to coordinate the development of smart contracts through multiple blockchains. Besides, to ensure the cross-chain security calculation, the signature by Cosi protocol and multi-signcryption algorithms are used in the transmission of non-private information and private information in the cross-chain process respectively.

Thus in this paper, we propose DynPilot, a novel solution for privacy-preserving verifiable location-based skyline queries over dynamic and encrypted data(sets). The key challenge is how to devise a ciphertext-based authenticated data structure (ADS) that not only protects the confidentiality of the dataset (including the verification phase), but also the effective maintenance of such a dataset. Moreover, to motivate the cloud into actively updating ADS, the digest of the raw dataset is stored in the blockchain due to its immutability and consensus mechanism where update cost is also considered. Therefore, we present a novel ADS (hereafter referred to as Dynamic-Efficient Secure and Verifiable Tree (DSV-tree)), designed to be dynamic and support secure and verifiable skyline queries. Meanwhile, DynPilot also achieves forward privacy using a novel fuzzy update strategy. To further improve the efficiency of queries, an optimized version (i.e., DSV*-tree) is also developed based on the idea of the multi-level index structure. Finally, we analyze the security and complexity of our approach, and the empirical evaluations demonstrate the utility of our approach.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2022.3224666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9966485","Location-based services;encrypted datasets;authenticated data structure;verifiable skyline queries;blockchain","Blockchains;Cryptography;Indexes;Costs;Data privacy;Servers;Smart contracts","","","","","","","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We then present an experimental study on the Nxt PoS behavior in a simulated environment and in a small network running Nxt private nodes. We show that the fractions of the blocks generated by forgers in the system are generally proportional to their weight in stakes provided that the weight is relatively small, which is consistent with the mathematical analysis. We consider two scenarios of double-spending attacks: (1) a single dominating forger with large stakes; and (2) a group of colluding forgers that collectively control large stakes. The simulation results show that the single-forger attack is more advantageous over using a pool of forgers in launching successful double-spending attacks. Finally, we propose a quota-based mechanism to limit the fraction of blocks that any forger could generate. We show that the mechanism is highly effective in mitigating the single-forger attack, but has limited success in preventing the double-spending attacks based on forging pools.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3193092","Cleveland State University Faculty Scholarship Initiative award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837462","Blockchain;Distributed Consensus;Proof of Work;Proof of Stake;Nxt;PeerCoin","Blockchains;Consensus algorithm;Peer-to-peer computing;Bitcoin;Behavioral sciences;Public key;Simulation","","","","","","","IEEE","22 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To achieve immersive user experiences in the metaverse, real-time rendering is the key technology. However, computing intensive tasks of real-time rendering from metaverse service providers cannot be processed efficiently on a single resource-limited mobile device. Alternatively, such mobile devices can offload the metaverse rendering tasks to other mobile devices by adopting the collaborative computing paradigm based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC). Therefore, this paper introduces a hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework for the metaverse services, especially for vehicular metaverse. In the framework, idle resources from vehicles, acting as CDC workers, are aggregated to handle intensive computation tasks in the vehicular metaverse. Specifically, in the upper layer, a miner coalition formation game is formulated based on a reputation metric to select reliable workers. To guarantee the reliable management of reputation values, the reputation values calculated based on the subjective logical model are maintained in a blockchain database. In the lower layer, a Stackelberg game based incentive mechanism is considered to attract reliable workers selected in the upper layer to participate in rendering tasks. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework is resistant to malicious workers. Compared with the baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can improve the utility of metaverse service provider and average profit of CDC workers.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3204839","Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality(grant numbers:2021Szvup092); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2001210,62102099); China Scholarship Council; National Research Foundation; AI Singapore Programme(grant numbers:AISG2-RP-2020-019); Singapore Ministry of Education(grant numbers:RG16/20); National Research Foundation, Singapore; Future Communications Research and Development Programme(grant numbers:SUTD SRG-ISTD-2021-165); IDEA(grant numbers:SUTD-ZJU (VP) 202102,SUTD-ZJU (SD) 202101); IDEA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9880566","Blockchain;coalition game;incentive mechanism;metaverse;reliable coded distributed computing;Stackelberg game","Metaverse;Reliability;Task analysis;Rendering (computer graphics);Mobile handsets;Games;Blockchains","","","","","","","CCBY","7 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To this end, this paper proposes a privacy-enhanced multi-area task assignment strategy, named PMTA. Specifically, we use deep differential privacy to add noise to patient data, and then put the noise-added dataset into a deep Q-network for training, combined with a spectral clustering algorithm, to obtain an optimal classification strategy. Further, in order to address the problem of data silos, we adopt federated learning to jointly train the classification models of different hospitals to obtain a global model and realize data sharing among different hospitals. Finally, we use the optimal classification of patients for task deployment on the blockchain, and limit patients to only apply for tasks of the corresponding level through the smart contract technology, so as to protect task privacy. Experimental results show that our strategy can not only effectively protect task and patient privacy, but also achieve better system performance.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3189439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9822973","Healthcare 4.0;Internet of Things;Mobile Crowdsensing;Blockchain;Federated Learning;Deep Differential Privacy","Task analysis;Data privacy;Medical services;Data models;Servers;Blockchains;Hospitals","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Most of the currently deployed GKE schemes are synchronous, i.e., they require all the participants to be online during their execution. However, with more battery-powered devices being used in such applications, the synchronicity requirement is challenging to fulfill. To fill the gaps, asynchronous GKE schemes have been introduced in the literature. Nevertheless, the currently available asynchronous and synchronous GKE schemes rely on Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) for key establishment and management. To this end, reliance on TTPs is a serious shortcoming since TTPs are well known to be the single point of failure. Furthermore, the existing GKE schemes require participants to perform all computations, which can degrade the performance of resource-constrained devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose an asynchronous GKE scheme that uses blockchain and smart contracts to store the security keys-related material and reduce the computational load of the participants.

To mitigate these problems, a perfect data protection, storage, and reputation management (DPSRM) scheme is proposed for ride-sharing services. First, a passenger utilizes the proposed ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm with partially hidden-policy, decryption test, and traceability, to encrypt her/his travel data. An authorized driver can successfully decrypt the ciphertext to acquire the passenger's travel data, then drive to the point of departure and wait for the passenger. Second, the data stored on the blockchain, such as the hash value of the ciphertext and the storage address of the ciphertext, can be used for digital forensics to achieve the distributed storage and traceability of data. Third, a reputation management based on the drivers' past behavior is proposed, which is a quantitative method to forecast the reliability of the drivers' future behavior and can be applied to settle the trust issue between passengers and drivers.

For some complicated tasks, essential features are owned by different data sellers offering data by blockchains. With limited budgets, buying features are crucial steps in knowledge discovery tasks in electricity spot markets, especially for learning based algorithms. However, there are lack of proper data pricing mechanisms tailored to dynamic learning processes. Besides, existing methods cannot efficiently employ edge computing servers to obtain optimal policies for selecting features according to dynamic pricing with limited budgets. To overcome such drawbacks, a data pricing mechanism is proposed in this paper, which consists of static and dynamic pricing parts. Based on this mechanism, given limited budgets, a feature selection algorithm considering multiple new factors is proposed, which offers near optimal solutions for feature selection at different scenarios. Numeric results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3127894","Science and Technology Projects of State Grid Corporation of China(grant numbers:SGHL0000BGJS2001883); Heilongjiang Province High School Basic Science Research Foundation for Heilongjiang University(grant numbers:RCCXYJ201909); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9614330","Internet of Energy;deep learning;data pricing.","Pricing;Feature extraction;Blockchains;Computational modeling;Edge computing;Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Highly correlated to the security of VDFs, the fastest implementation for VDF evaluation is generally desired to be publicly known. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a low-latency hardware implementation for the complete VDF evaluation in the class group by jointly exploiting optimizations. On one side, we reduce the required computational cycles by decreasing the hardware-unfriendly divisions and increase the parallelism of computations by reducing the data dependency. On the other side, we provide low-latency large-number divisors, multipliers, and adders, respectively, while those operators are generally very hard to be accelerated. Besides, we carefully schedule the sub-modules and devise the low-latency architecture for the complete VDF evaluation. Finally, the proposed design is coded and synthesized under the TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology. The experimental results show that our design can achieve a speedup of 3.5x compared to the optimal C++ implementation for the VDF evaluation over an advanced CPU. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art hardware implementation for the squaring, a key step of VDF, we achieve about 2x speedup.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2022.3219723","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62104097); Key Research Plan of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BE2022098); High-Level Personnel Project of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:JSSCBS20210034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9939098","Verifiable delay functions;class groups;extended GCD;low-latency;blockchain;ASIC","Low latency communication;Hardware;Security;Delays;Computer architecture;Blockchains;Software algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","4 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the impacts of these subsidies on the mask supply chain (MSC) operations are unclear. Motivated by our interview with a mask manufacturer as well as the observed real-world practices, we establish consumer utility-based stylized models to analytically examine government subsidies and policies in the MSC. We utilize the infection transmission model to capture the social health risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. The government aims to maximize social welfare, which includes the manufacturer's profit, consumer surplus, social health risk, and government subsidy expenditure. Results indicate that when the price is not controlled (i.e., the manufacturer decides it), the manufacturer and consumer subsidy programs are equally efficient in enhancing consumer surplus as well as reducing harm to social health risk under COVID-19. Thus, the government can conduct a subsidy scheme that is easier to implement in practice. However, we surprisingly find that the government's excessive intervention will cause disequilibrium in the MSC. When the price or the manufacturer's dishonest behavior is fully controlled by the government, subsidizing the MSC is not always advisable. Besides, our findings are consistent with the public interest theory; that is, the proper implementation of dishonesty prevention and pricing control policies can improve social welfare but sacrifice consumer surplus.

"Improving Bitcoin’s Post-Quantum Transaction Efficiency with a Novel Lattice-Based Aggregate Signature Scheme Based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and a STARK Protocol","Y. Quan","Charlotte Country Day School, Charlotte, NC, USA","IEEE Access","","2022","PP","99","1","1","This paper proposes a novel lattice-based aggregate signature (LAS) scheme that bring post-quantum security to the Bitcoin system without sacrificing its transaction efficiency. Bitcoin currently employs Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is insecure against the emerging quantum technology, so post-quantum signature schemes like the proposed LAS will become necessary in the near future. However, most of the post-quantum signatures schemes have large signature sizes which decrease Bitcoin’s efficiency while our proposed scheme does not have this negative side effect. Our LAS scheme is based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and a zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (STARK) protocol. CRYSTALS-Dilithium is the most prominent algorithm chosen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), yet it still has an adverse limitation: it would cause Bitcoin’s transaction efficiency to fall by 17 times due to its relatively large signature size. On the other hand, the proposed LAS scheme takes full advantage of signature aggregation using the STARK protocol and Dilithium’s easy and fast implementation, thus generating signatures with post-quantum security and small signature sizes which are critical to transaction efficiency. Our proofs convey the correctness, compactness, and post-quantum security of our construction in the quantum random oracle model, and our implementation conveyed that the proposed scheme would only decrease Bitcoin’s transaction efficiency by 3 times, a significant improvement from using Dilithium and other lattice-based aggregate signature schemes. Our proposed scheme has many advantages over the existing schemes and may become very valuable to Bitcoin.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3227394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973246","Digital Signatures;Post-Quantum Cryptography;Lattice-Based Aggregate Signature Scheme;CRYSTALS-Dilithium;STARK Protocol;Bitcoin Blockchain","Bitcoin;Aggregates;Protocols;Digital signatures;Blockchains;Public key;NIST;Cryptography;Quantum computing","","","","","","","CCBY","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we propose a mixing protocol for the Bitcoin Network based on zero-knowledge proof, called SofitMix. It is the first mixing protocol that can effectively resist both the DoS attack and the collusion attack. It can also support a set of parallel off-chain payments in a reliable way no matter whether some payers abort a transaction.

Qin",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"IEEE Network","","2022","PP","99","1","7","The recently emerging federated learning (FL) exploits massive data stored at multiple user nodes to train a global optimal learning model without leaking the privacy of user data. However, it is still inadequate to learn the global model safely at the centralized aggregator, which is an essential part for the traditional FL architecture. Specifically, when using FL in radio access networks to enable edge intelligence, it is difficult for a central server, which belongs to a third party, to guarantee its credibility. Moreover, because the central server may cause a single point of failure, its reliability is also difficult to guarantee. Besides, a malicious participating node of FL may send ill parameters for model aggregation. In this article, we develop a blockchain assisted federated learning (BC-FL) framework, with aim to overcome the single point of failure caused by central server. Meanwhile, we propose to use blockchain to implement auditing of individual involved nodes to ensure the reliability of learning process. To avoid privacy leakage during the audit process to the greatest extent, we design a matching audit mechanism to realize efficient random matching audit process. A cryptocurrency free delegated byzantine fault tolerant (CF-DBFT) consensus mechanism is also designed to realize the low-latency distributed consensus of all nodes in the FL proces. We apply the proposed BC-FL framework to resolve the computing resource allocation problem at the edger servers in MEC network. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance superiority of the proposed BC-FL framework. Compared with legacy FL algorithm, the serving time of MEC servers and utilization of computing resource are increased by 35% and 48% respectively under our proposed BC-FL algorithm.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.115.2200014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9839627","","Collaborative work;Data models;Training;Servers;Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance;Consensus protocol","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

How to ensure desirable capacity and imperceptibility has become a key issue in text steganography. There are two typical approaches, i.e., text-selection-based steganography and text-generation-based steganography. However, the text-selection-based approaches generally have the very low hidden capacity and are not applicable in practical scenarios. Although the text-generation-based approaches can embed secret messages with higher capacity during text generation, they are prone to semantic incoherence and semantic errors when generating long texts. To address the abovementioned issues, this article proposes a novel text steganography based on long readable text generation. It first determines the topic of the stego-text according to the scenarios of the communication parties. Then, the plug and play language model (PPLM) is explored to generate the long readable stego-text conforming to the topic with semantic coherency. A given secret message is hidden during text generation by selecting proper words in an established embeddable candidate word pool (ECWP). Establishing the ECWP prevents the language model (LM) from selecting words with low probability in the text generation, thereby avoiding the generation of low-quality or even grammatically incorrect stego-text. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly increases hidden capacity while maintaining good imperceptibility compared with the existing approaches.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3174013","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972205,62122032,62102189); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS through Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP18K18044,JP21K17736); Jiangsu Basic Research Programs-Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:BK20181407,BK20200807); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions PAPD Fund; Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology CICAEET Fund China; China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201908320532); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9778236","Automatic text generation;embeddable candidate word pool (ECWP);generative steganography;text steganography.","Steganography;Semantics;Databases;Resists;Computational modeling;Encoding;Electronic mail","","","","","","","IEEE","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As the first framework for network monitoring in SDN-NV, we identify three challenges: non-isolated and inaccurate statistics, high monitoring delay, and excessive control channel consumption for gathering statistics. To address these challenges, V-Sight introduces three key mechanisms: 1) statistics virtualization for isolated statistics, 2) transmission disaggregation for reduced transmission delay, and 3) pCollector aggregation for efficient control channel consumption. The evaluation results reveal that V-Sight successfully provides accurate and isolated statistics while reducing the monitoring delay and control channel consumption in orders of magnitude.

Automatically caching needed services on the nearest edge nodes and dynamically scheduling users’ requests can realize that computing power and software services flow with the users to provide continuous services. However, achieving the goal needs to overcome many challenges, such as the significant fluctuation of user devices’ requests at the edge side and the lack of collaboration among edge nodes.

We introduce a threatening and realistically implementable backdoor attack that is highly stealthy and flexible. We inject trojans by hijacking the built-in functions of the deep learning framework. Unlike existing backdoor attacks, the proposed sequential trigger is a specific sequence of clean image sets. Moreover, our attack is model agnostic and does not require retraining the model or modifying the parameters. Its stealthy is that injecting trojans will not change the models prediction for a clean image. Its flexibility lies in that adversary can remodify the trojan behavior at any time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks with different frameworks demonstrate that our attack achieves a perfect success rate. And we can inject multiple trojans which do not affect each other at the same time.

This is done by mixing the transactions of multiple users into a single aggregated transaction in which the output addresses have been secretly shuffled. In our protocol design, we first develop HDCnet, a secure shuffling protocol that enables a group of users to anonymously publish their data. Then, we deploy the proposed HDCnet protocol in the UCoin architecture (as a mixing unit) to generate the aggregate transactions.

The purpose is to solve the problems in the communication security of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and improve the vulnerability of traditional distributed architecture. The security issues of the Internet of vehicles (IoV) in 5G environment are analyzed from the perspective of big data. An access control mechanism based on risk prediction is proposed aiming at the problems existing in the node access control process. A Wasserstein Distance-based Combined Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN) is proposed. It modifies the loss function to solve the gradient disappearance problem, and a combination of multiple generators is designed to solve the pattern collapse. The simulation experiment is carried out on the dataset of the intrusion detection evaluation project. The WCGAN model has the smallest prediction error than the other models regarding the node packet transmission rate. Its loss value is close to 0 after 10 iterations, while the loss value of the BP neural network (BPNN) is about 0.28. The prediction accuracy of the WCGAN model can reach 86.3% when the training set is 5000, which is much higher than that of BPNN (77.8%). The reason is that the WCGAN model increases the number of generators according to GAN, which improves the low accuracy caused by pattern collapse. The IoT-based ITS can implement corresponding strategies according to the prediction results and control the access rights of nodes, thus ensuring the security of information resources effectively. The research content reduces the communication delay under ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information in the process of data transmission, and provides a reference for ensuring the safe communication of IoV.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3141788","Basic Tasks of Technical Forecasting by Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development CASTED; College Scientific Research Project of China University of Political Science and Law(grant numbers:20ZFG63001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9740408","Big data;5G Internet of Thing;intelligent transportation system;communication security;risk prediction.","Security;5G mobile communication;Transportation;Big Data;Blockchains;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Roads","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Despite its potential to strongly boost the blockchain throughput, sharding comes with its own security issues. To ease the process of deciding which shard to place transactions, existing sharding protocols use a hash-based transaction sharding in which the hash value of a transaction determines its output shard. Unfortunately, we show that this mechanism opens up a loophole that could be exploited to conduct a single-shard flooding attack, a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, to overwhelm a single shard that ends up reducing the performance of the system as a whole. To counter the single-shard flooding attack, we propose a countermeasure that essentially eliminates the loophole by rejecting the use of hash-based transaction sharding. The countermeasure leverages the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to let blockchain's validators securely execute a transaction sharding algorithm with a negligible overhead. We provide a formal specification for the countermeasure and analyze its security properties in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept is developed to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our solution.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2022.3174560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773947","","Blockchains;Floods;Throughput;Bitcoin;Security;Denial-of-service attack;Scalability","","","","","","","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Motivated by such data protection and consistency issues, in this work we design and implement a mechanism for securely deleting data from Bitcoin blockchain. We use zero-knowledge proofs to allow any node to delete some data from Bitcoin transactions, still preserving the public verifiability of the correctness of the spent and spendable coins. Moreover, we specifically use STARK proofs to exploit the transparency that they provide. Our solution, unlike previous approaches, avoids the complications of asking nodes to reach consensus on the content to delete.

State-of-the-art techniques to secure manufacturing processes mostly rely on watermarking, which embeds hidden information inside CAD models to prove ownership and authenticity. Nevertheless, such techniques tamper with the model itself, while existing attacks allow removing such watermarks altogether. To address these shortcomings, we integrate signal processing and cryptographic techniques and describe a tailored solution for CAD model ownership and supply chain management. Our approach generates unique identifiers for 3D designs using frequency-domain transforms and employs non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that persist on public distributed ledgers. Our NFTs are implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and their functionality is twofold: (a) authenticate the owner of a CAD model, and (b) enable ownership transfer.

However, the classic Proof-based blockchain systems have problems such as unsatisfactory system throughput, low consensus efficiency and excessive computing resource consumption, making it difficult to directly apply them to the IoT environment. The recently proposed Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) represented by Tangle is designed based on the logical structure of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which significantly improves the transaction confirmation delay and system throughput, making it more suitable for IoT scenarios. This paper focuses on the performance and security of Tangle DLT in IoT applications with network instability. Such unstable network environment can be caused by the pre-defined node working mode or signal interference, which leads to the status switching between online (work-mode) and offline (sleep-mode) of nodes or unstable data transmission. Firstly, a Markov chain based model is established to analyze the time delay of block propagation in the underlying network under different status switching rate, different generation rates of blocks, different nodes’ average uplink bandwidths and different number of neighbor nodes. Next, the impact of block propagation delay on the consensus efficiency and system throughput is analyzed. Furthermore, we also analyze the influence of block propagation delay on the attacker’s decision to conduct a double-spending attack under different network load, and deduce the suitable moment for the attacker to broadcast the parasite chain to maximize the probability of successful attack. Finally, through detailed numerical simulations, the experimental results comprehensively reveal the performance and security of the Tangle system in the unstable network environment.

However, the continuous heterogeneity and densification of 5G networks pose great challenges to network security, especially for user mobility support. In the process of user handover between BSs or between different network domains, user access authentication and security session establishment are far riskier compared to 4G networks. On one hand, the overhead of handover authentication increases significantly as handovers become more frequent in an ultradense network. On the other hand, the differentiation of security schemes in heterogeneous networks poses a big challenge to handover authentication. Successfully designing a secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient handover authentication protocol for heterogeneous and ultra-dense 5G networks would substantially expand the prospects of future 5G network applications. Although numerous solutions (e.g., challengeresponse-based, public key cryptography-based, physical layer information-based, and blockchain-based solutions) have been proposed to solve the cross-domain handover authentication problem, most of them surfer from security and privacy vulnerabilities and unreasonable performance overhead. In this paper, we propose XAuth, a secure and privacy-preserving authentication protocol for both intra-domain and inter-domain handover in 5G Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) based on blockchain. The proposed protocol can achieve mutual authentication, key agreement between User Equipment (UE) and target network, and is characterized by forward secrecy, backward secrecy, user anonymity, and conditional privacy preservation.

While the underlying platforms guarantee the correctness of smart-contract execution, they cannot ensure that the code of a contract is correct. Today, as evidenced by a number of recent security breaches, developers still have a hard time making contracts that work properly.Even though these incidents often exploit contract interaction, prior work on smart-contract verification, vulnerability discovery, and secure development typically considers only individual contracts in isolation. To address this gap, we introduce the <sc>VeriSolid</sc> framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a abstract state machine based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify the behavior of a set of interacting contracts at a high level of abstraction. <sc>VeriSolid</sc> allows the generation of Solidity code that is functionally and behaviorally equivalent to verified models, which enables the creation of correct-by-design smart contracts. We additionally introduce a graphical notation (called <italic>deployment diagrams</italic>) for specifying possible interactions between contract types. Based on this notation, we present a framework for the automated verification, generation, and deployment of contracts that conform to a deployment diagram. To demonstrate the applicability of <sc>VeriSolid</sc>, we translate existing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) specifications to temporal properties for two of the most popular contract interfaces: ERC20 and ERC721. We also show you how to write code for the ERC20 and ERC721 interfaces in a way that is safe, and we do this by using <sc>VeriSolid</sc>. We evaluate our framework on 726 contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, which include 267 ERC20 and 459 ERC721 contracts.

To address these problems, we introduce a proof-of-hardware-stake (PohS) consensus mechanism and a regulatory mechanism based on a consortium blockchain. Our approach is implemented in a sharding blockchain to scale the consensus.

Due to the high dynamics and resource constraints of the IoV, the traditional single-chain blockchain system is not suitable for the practical scenarios. In our previous work, we proposed a lightweight blockchain architecture based on the Directed Acyclic Graph lattice (DAG-lattice) structure for the IoV. However, the current consensus algorithms are not suitable for the previous architecture mentioned above. Therefore, this paper proposes a parallel consensus mechanism based on the DAG-lattice structure in the IoV using Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) as consensus algorithm. This mechanism solves the problem of low efficiency of PBFT caused by too many consensus nodes and the mobility of nodes by adopting the method of network sharding, and meanwhile to ensure that transactions can be reached on consensus parallelly. To avoid the selection of primary nodes from being predicted in advance, this paper proposes a primary node selection method based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF). Moreover, a method is proposed of selecting transactions based on Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduling to motivate nodes for the purpose of maintaining a high reputation score. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is verified by experiments whose results show that the proposed consensus mechanism shows better performance than other comparable schemes in terms of the time added to the blockchain, Transaction Per Second (TPS), consensus success rate, and the time of obtaining transaction. And the proposed mechanism is less dependent on Roadside Unit (RSU).","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3222217","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61862046); Science and Technology Program of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2020GG0188); Hohhot Science & Technology Plan(grant numbers:2021-KJXM-TZJW-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951064","Internet of Vehicles;blockchain;DAG-lattice;PBFT;parallel consensus mechanism;network sharding","Consensus algorithm;Consensus protocol;Vehicle dynamics;Computer architecture;Scalability;Periodic structures;Wireless communication","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Moreover, we study the voters with similar voting behaviors and propose methods to discover abnormal mutual voting behaviors in EOSIO. The analysis results show how EOSIO gradually evolves from decentralization to oligopoly and our methods can effectively capture abnormal voting phenomena in the EOSIO, which can also provide important insights for the design and maintenance of other DPoS-based blockchains.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3191350","Development Program of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2021CXGC010108); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973325); Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011661); Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:202103050004); Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Project(grant numbers:202102020616); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9839582","Blockchain;decentralization;delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS);EOSIO;network analysis","Production;Consensus protocol;Behavioral sciences;Voting;Oligopoly;Decentralized applications;Indexes","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

There has been a rising interest in the design of consensus protocols since they play a central role in blockchain architecture. However, many recently proposed consensus protocols lack experimental verification which hampers the possible deployment of these protocols in real-world blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose a simple tool called SIM-P that can accurately simulate the behavior of these consensus protocols with ease. It is an agent-based stochastic simulator that relies on the sequential Monte Carlo method to model how block publishers are selected. The likelihood of each node (represented as agents) being selected as a block publisher is represented by independent trials in a binomial experiment. We provide a base SIM-P model that simulates Proof of Work (PoW) for benchmarking purposes. The PoW model also serves as the basic structure of the simulator that can be adapted to other protocols. We showcase the flexibility of SIM-P by proposing two additional simulation models for– Proof of Reputation-X and Proof of Contribution, both of which lack experimental verification in their original design specifications. We show how the simulator can be used to produce vital metrics such as throughput, resistance against the 51% attack, and energy consumption. We verify the accuracy of SIM-P by comparing PoW’s simulated results with theoretical estimates and historical Bitcoin data.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3221916","Universiti Sains Malaysia(grant numbers:1001/PKOMP/8580013); Universiti Tenaga Nasional(grant numbers:J510050002/2021052); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9950273","Blockchain;simulator;consensus protocol;Proof of Work;Proof of Reputation;Proof of Contribution","Consensus protocol;Protocols;Bitcoin;Peer-to-peer computing;Adaptation models;Stochastic processes;Internet of Things","","","","","","","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Access to sensitive data and medical equipment should be granted or denied according to the current health situation of the patient. To handle the need for adaptable access control of healthcare scenarios, we propose a novel model that allows dynamic access control decisions based on the context characterizing the source, type of access request, patient, and estimated risk corresponding to the conditions of the patient. Estimating patient status risk requires analyzing vital physiological data whose availability is growing, thanks to the widespread diffusion of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. Inferring the patient health status risk through machine learning (ML) techniques is possible, but to achieve better accuracy, the training phase requires the aggregation of vast amounts of data from different sources. This aggregation could be difficult or even impossible due to organization regulations and privacy laws. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel federated learning risk-based authorization middleware for healthcare (FRAMH) that supports risk-based access control to deal with changing and unforeseen medical situations. Our solution infers the risk of health status through a federated learning (FL) approach enriched with blockchain to avoid the weaknesses of centralized servers. The implemented prototype and a large set of experimental results demonstrate the advantages of FL in estimating the risk in healthcare scenarios. Through this approach, even a medical institution with a limited dataset can achieve a satisfying risk estimation and efficient access control enforcement.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3210372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9915483","Access control;authorization;federated learning (FL);healthcare;risk-based access control","Medical services;Blockchains;Data models;Servers;Authorization;Adaptation models;Training","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To solve this problem, we propose a hierarchical trajectory anomaly detection scheme for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) using both machine learning and blockchain technologies.

For some categories of NFTs like arts and game collectibles, owners can sell them for a profit. However, popular marketplaces trade NFTs using public auctions and direct offers. Hence, an observer can learn about the new owner and the NFT purchase price. To tackle those problems, we propose Aegis, a protocol that allows users to add privacy to their NFTs ownership.

However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning.

To overcome this limitation, this letter takes the dynamic changes of the accuracy of the estimated gradients as a starting point, and develops a Dynamic Meta Attack (DMA). At the beginning of each fine-tuning round, DMA computes the distance between the above two types of gradients. Such distance metric can reflect the accuracy of the meta-gradients, and guide the dynamic adjustment of query frequency for the ZOO-gradients. Moreover, the working flow of the dynamic fine-tuning process can be controlled by a set of parameters, which are of physical significance and easy to be tuned. By this means, DMA merely launches queries at critical moments, greatly saving query resource. Experiments conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 show that the proposed DMA requires far fewer queries than existing methods while maintaining a satisfying attack success rate and distortion.

However, existing multi-factor user authentication methods usually require multiple interactions between users and different authentication components when inputting the multiple factors, leading to extra overhead and bad user experience. In this paper, we propose a secure and user-friendly multi-factor user authentication system named BioDraw. It utilizes four categories of biometrics (impedance, geometry, behavior, and composition) of human hand plus the pattern-based password to identify and authenticate users. User only needs to draw a pattern on a radio frequency identification tag array, while four biometrics can be collected simultaneously. Specifically, we first design a gradient-based pattern recognition algorithm to precisely extract user’s secret pattern. Then, a convolutional neural network-and long short-term memory-based classifier is utilized for user recognition. Furthermore, to guarantee the systemic security, an anti-replay method called Binary ALOHA is proposed to detect replayed signals. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 volunteers. The experiment results show that BioDraw can achieve high authentication accuracy (with a 2% $-$  false reject rate) and is effective in defending against various attacks.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2022.3208002","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021QY0703); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20462,61872285,62032021,61772236,61972348); Research Institute of Cyberspace Governance in Zhejiang University; Leading Innovative and Entrepreneur Team Introduction Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2018R01005); Ant Group(grant numbers:Z51202000234); Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913895","Radio frequency identification;multi-factor user authentication;replay defense","Authentication;Biometrics (access control);Impedance;Protocols;Layout;Equivalent circuits;Couplings","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Existing works mainly learn a texture mapping model from the source to the target faces. However, they rarely consider the geometric constraints on the internal deformation arising from pose variations, which causes a high level of uncertainty in face pose modeling, and hence, produces inferior results for large pose variations. Moreover, current methods typically suffer from undesired facial details loss due to the adoption of the de-facto standard encoder–decoder architecture without any skip connections (SCs). In this article, we directly learn and exploit geometric constraints and propose a fully deformable network to simultaneously model the deformations of both landmarks and faces for face synthesis. Specifically, our model consists of two parts: a deformable landmark learning network (DLLN) and a gated deformable face synthesis network (GDFSN). The DLLN converts an initial reference landmark to an individual-specific target landmark as delicate pose guidance for face rotation. The GDFSN adopts a dual-stream structure, with one stream estimating the deformation of two views in the form of convolution offsets according to the source pose and the converted target pose, and the other leveraging the predicted deformation offsets to create the target face. In this way, individual-aware pose changes are explicitly modeled in the face generator to cope with geometric transformation, by adaptively focusing on pertinent regions of the source face. To compensate for offset estimation errors, we introduce a soft-gating mechanism for adaptive fusion between deformable features and primitive features. Additionally, a pose-aligned SC (PASC) is tailored to propagate low-level input features to the appropriate positions in the output features for further enhancing the facial details and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that our approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts, especially with large pose changes.

Unlike the traditional FLML service that separates the parcel collection in the first mile from the parcel delivery in the last mile, a new type of crowdsourced FLML service integrates parcel collection and parcel delivery services as a whole, which can significantly improve the efficiency of FLML service. Briefly, in a crowdsourced FLML service, the platform assigns the customers' triggered pick-up parcels to the couriers who are delivering drop-off parcels in terms of the real-time status of couriers (e.g., capacity, location, and schedule). Existing works solving the crowdsourced FLML problem only consider the utility maximization for the platform but ignore the incentive to the utilities of couriers. Inspired by this, in this paper, we investigate a novel type of crowdsourced FLML problem, namely Auction-based Crowdsourced FLML (ACF), where the platform assigns the couriers with suitable pick-up parcels based on the preferences of couriers with the goal of maximizing the social welfare of the platform and couriers. To solve the ACF problem, we present a novel auction model named Multi-attribute Reverse Vickrey (MRV), where the couriers bid on parcels according to their preferences for parcels. Based on the MRV model, we present three efficient assignment algorithms to assign parcels to couriers. In addition, we give theoretical analysis for our proposed algorithms.

To establish a sustainable VSN, it is of practical value to possess a strong ability for fake content detection. Related works can be divided into the global semantics-based approaches and the local semantics-based approaches, though both with limitations. Leveraging these two different approaches, this paper proposes a fake content detection model based on the mixed graph neural networks (GNN) for sustainable VSN. It takes GNN as the bottom architecture and integrates both convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks to capture two aspects of semantics. Such a mixed detection framework is expected to possess a better detection effect.

In practice, the available spectrum is often limited. With the rapid increase of D2D users and cellular users, the efficiency of resource allocation would be dramatically reduced. To overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes a spiking mean field reinforcement learning framework (S-MFRL) to optimize the resource allocation of D2D networks. Firstly, spiking neural network (SNN) cooperated with deep reinforcement learning is trained for channel selection and power control. Secondly, spatio-temporal backpropagation is adopted to accelerate the SNN training. Thirdly, mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MFRL) is applied to approximate interactions among D2D users. By this means, the optimization process of resource allocation becomes tractable as the number of D2D users increases, which solves the problem of exponential growth of user interactions. Two algorithms are implemented under the S-MFRL framework by integrating MFRL into spiking actor-critic (S-AC) and spiking proximal policy optimization (S-PPO), which are named S-MFAC and S-MFPPO, respectively. Experimental results show that our designed S-MFAC and S-MFPPO outperform both AC and PPO in terms of convergence rate, access rate, time-averaged overall throughput, and collision probability. Besides, further simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the case of larger action space and hundreds of D2D users.

Although many forensic researches have focused on this new type of manipulation and achieved high detection accuracy, most of which are based on supervised learning mechanism with requiring a large number of labeled samples for training. In this paper, we first develop a novel unsupervised detection manner for identifying deepfake videos. The main fundamental behind our proposed method is that the face region in the real video is taken by the camera while its counterpart in the deepfake video is usually generated by the computer; the provenance of two videos is totally different. Specifically, our method includes two clustering stages based on Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) and noiseprint feature. Firstly, the PRNU fingerprint of each video frame is extracted, which is used to cluster the full-size identical source video (regardless of its real or fake). Secondly, we extract the noiseprint from the face region of the video, which is used to identify (re-cluster for the task of binary classification) the deepfake sample in each cluster. Numerical experiments verify our proposed unsupervised method performs very well on our own dataset and the benchmark FF++ dataset. More importantly, its performance rivals that of the supervised-based state-of-the-art detectors.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2022.3182509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795231","Deepfake detection;unsupervised learning;video clustering;PRNU;noiseprint","Faces;Streaming media;Cameras;Feature extraction;Forensics;Cyberspace;Training","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To tackle this issue, in this paper, a self-supervised domain adaptation network, which is composed of a backbone network with Siamese architecture and a compression approximation network (ComNet), is proposed for JPEG-resistant image forgery detection and localization. To improve the performance against JPEG compression, ComNet is customized to approximate the JPEG compression operation through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images with general JPEG compression characteristics. The backbone network is then trained with domain adaptation strategy to localize the tampering boundary and region, and alleviate the domain shift between uncompressed and JPEG-agent images.

Supported by considerable geographical data acquisition ability of mobile Internet of Things (IoT), the MEN can also provide spatial locations-based social service to users. Therefore, suggesting reasonable points-of-interest (POIs) to users is essential to improve user experience of MEN. As the simple user-location data is usually sparse and not informative, existing literature attempted to extend feature space from two perspectives: contextual patterns and semantic patterns. However, previous approaches mainly focused on internal features of users, yet ignoring latent external features among them. To address this challenge, in this paper, a deep distributed learning-based POI recommendation (Deep-PR) method is proposed for situations of MEN. In particular, hidden feature components from both local and global subspaces are deeply abstracted via representative learning schemes. Besides, propagation operations are embedded to iteratively reoptimize expressions of the feature space. The successive effect of the above two aspects contributes a lot to more fine-grained feature spaces, so that recommendation accuracy can be ensured. Two types of experiments are also carried out on three real-world datasets to assess both efficiency and stability of the proposed Deep-PR.

The empirical results show that the technology context (IT infrastructure and digital tools) along with the existing level of innovation are the main drivers that act as stepping stones in digital technology adoption. Corporate regulation, available skills, and financial resources (as organizational variables) also play a significant role in the adoption decision. Unexpectedly, the influence of the environmental context is marginal. The implications of this study are emphasized for theory and practice, laying a foundation for further empirical studies in this field. Managerial relevance statement: This article reviews the empirical research on digital technologies adoption and examines the drivers of such adoption in SMEs. The factors identified provide guidance for practitioners adopting digital technologies in SMEs, by suggesting they assess the readiness of their firms before investing in digital technology. This research helps advance the conversation on digitalization drivers especially by bringing the discussion into the organization boundaries, as our findings highlight the predominance of organizational drivers over the technological and environmental ones. SMEs have to overcome the challenges associated with constructing an IT infrastructure capable of implementing new technologies. Indeed, while striving to adopt new digital technologies (e.g., AI, big data, IoT), many SMEs are still unprepared. Therefore, rather than adopting mimetic behaviors based on external pressure, SMEs that aim for digitalization should first assess their existing technologies, and further develop a meticulous technological roadmap that includes skills upgrades and investments in upskilling employees’ capabilities.

In our work, we propose a privacy-preserving solution, called Private Driver DNA, which designs a possible architecture, allowing drivers of an ITS to receive customized services. The proposed solution is based on the concept of Driver DNA as characterization of driver’s driving style. To assure privacy, we perform the operations directly on sanitized data, using the Order Revealing Encryption (ORE) method. Besides, the proposed solution is integrated with ITS architecture defined in the European project E-Corridor. The result is an effective privacy-preserving architecture for ITS to offer customized products, which can be used to address drivers’ behaviors, for example, to environmental-friendly attitudes or a more safe driving style. We test Private Driver DNA using a synthetic dataset generated with the vehicle simulator CARLA.

Therefore, our research uses Nova Empire as a case study, aiming at understanding metaverse engagement via complexity analysis of social patterns and reward mechanisms. Specifically, the behavioral data of 46 954 players in September 2021 are used for analysis. Our observations show that social behavior is not the main factor for user engagement.

The results prove that the main factors affecting user engagement are game tasks and reward mechanisms in the early stage and social gaming behaviors environment with alliances in the middle and late stages.

Besides this attack, existing work requires heavy computations to execute user matching, and it is challenging for riders to verify matching results.

Despite the profitable usage of AI-based algorithms, these data-driven methods are facing issues such as the scarcity and privacy of user data, as well as the difficulty of institutions exchanging medical information. With insufficient data, ML is prevented from reaching its full potential, which is only possible if the database consists of the full spectrum of possible anatomies, pathologies, and input data types. To solve these issues, Federated Learning (FL) appeared as a valuable approach in the medical field, allowing patient data to stay where it is generated. Since an FL setting allows many clients to collaboratively train a model while keeping training data decentralized, it can protect privacy-sensitive medical data. However, FL is still unable to deliver all its promises and meets the more stringent requirements (e.g., latency, security) of a healthcare system based on multiple Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For example, although no data are shared among the participants by definition in FL systems, some security risks are still present and can be considered as vulnerabilities from multiple aspects. This paper sheds light upon the emerging deployment of FL, provides a broad overview of current approaches and existing challenges, and outlines several directions of future work that are relevant to solving existing problems in federated healthcare, with a particular focus on security and privacy issues.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2022.3185673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804708","Federated learning;internet of medical things;healthcare;privacy","Medical services;Security;Data models;Training;Data privacy;Blockchains;Privacy","","","","","","","CCBY","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A dynamic allocation of unallocated resource blocks (RBs) to mobile units (MUs) is carried out and once the allocation of RBs is complete, we integrate blockchain (BC) to record the transactional ledgers.

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been proven to be one of the most effective technologies for energy management. However, recent studies have shown that the use of DVS leads to a significant increase in the transient fault rate of processors as the characteristic size of logic gates (or transistors) gets smaller and smaller. In this paper, we consider the problem of assigning processing frequencies to a group of periodic real-time tasks so as to minimize the overall energy consumption under the constraints of time and reliability. Firstly, under the DVS, we take the reliability of the embedded systems into consideration through the regularization terms and present the energy consumption optimization model based on the meta-heuristic algorithms. Secondly, a novel algorithm for adaptive differential whale swarm optimization (ADWOA) is proposed according to the optimization requirements. Finally, the optimized data are saved on the chain through the storable feature of the blockchain for the necessary queries. It is worth noting that the on-chain data contains the intrinsic characteristics of the embedded system, which may give rise to the disclosure of processor privacy. Therefore, we come up with the differential privacy on-chain creating algorithm (DPCA) to protect the privacy of data on the chain. Experimental results show that ADWOA can minimize the energy consumption in real-time embedded system on the premise of ensuring system reliability and privacy.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2022.3215690","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702062,61932006); Key Project of Technology Innovation and Application Development of Chongqing(grant numbers:CSTC2019jscx-mbdxX0064); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9924228","Real-time embedded system;Dynamic voltage scaling;Reliability;Meta-heuristic;Blockchain","Energy consumption;Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Reliability;Real-time systems;Program processors;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Identifiers (ID) are always attached to them to trace running instances or entities in logs. Therefore, log messages can be grouped by the same IDs to help anomaly detection and localization. The existing approaches to achieve this still fall short meeting these challenges: 1) Log is solely processed in single components without mining log dependencies. 2) Log formats are continually changing in modern software systems. 3) It is challenging to detect latent performance issues non-intrusively by trivial monitoring tools. To remedy the above shortcomings, we propose SwissLog, a robust anomaly detection and localization tool for interleaved unstructured logs. SwissLog focuses on log sequential anomalies and tries to dig out possible performance issues. SwissLog constructs ID relation graphs across distributed components and groups log messages by IDs. Moreover, we propose an online data-driven log parser without parameter tuning. The grouped log messages are parsed via the novel log parser and transformed with semantic and temporal embedding. Finally, SwissLog utilizes an attention-based Bi-LSTM model and a heuristic searching algorithm to detect and localize anomalies in instance-granularity, respectively. The experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of SwissLog.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3162857","Basic and Applied Basic Research of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202002030328); National Key Research Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1804002); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515012229); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010165002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802448,U1811462); the Project of Core Blockchain of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:No. 2020KJ010801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9744513","deep learning;log parsing;anomaly detection;anomaly localization;log correlation","Location awareness;Anomaly detection;Containers;Codes;Semantics;Tuning;Software systems","","","","","","","IEEE","29 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Predicting such critical points is important to give warnings to system managers to take precautionary measures aimed at achieving high resource utilization, quality of service (QoS), and profit of the investment. Existing researches mainly focus on point value prediction only, whereas trend-based turning point prediction is not considered. This is partly due to the fact that traditional trend prediction methods have a weak ability to represent the cloud features, which means that they cannot describe the highly-variable cloud workloads time series. This paper introduces a novel cloud workload turning point prediction approach based on cloud feature-enhanced deep learning. Firstly, we establish a turning point prediction model of cloud server workload by taking cloud workload features into consideration. Then, a cloud feature-enhanced deep learning model is designed for workload turning point prediction. Experiments on the most famous Google cluster demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared with state-of-the-art models.

However, these SGX-based solutions are vulnerable to some traffic analyses, and loading all tasks into the enclave introduces much overhead for frequent EPC-paging. In this paper, we propose a T-SGX framework, which keeps the confidentiality of a distributed job and guarantees the system efficiency by allowing dynamically loading an enclave shared object for the task under processing. In T-SGX, all these objects are secretly shared and stored in a verifiably distributed share management system (SMS) outside the TCB. To mitigate the exposure of sensitive information, we present an efficient oblivious transfer (OT) protocol under the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption for obliviously transmitting desired shares. Detailed security analysis demonstrates that the proposed T-SGX achieves the goal of secure distributed computing without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties. Finally, we benchmark the framework in six real-world applications, and the experimental results show that T-SGX significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art solution, with 11.9%-29.7% less overhead performing an SGX-based application.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2021.3123511","Science Foundation of Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Agency(grant numbers:2020J02016); The Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2020010601012187); The Blockchain Core Technology Strategic Research Program of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:2020KJ010301); The Young Talent Promotion Project of Fujian Science and Technology Association; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972094, 62032005, 61872087, 61872089, 61972294); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591264","Cloud computing;Distributed computing framework;Secret sharing;Intel SGX;Privacy-preserving","Cloud computing;Protocols;Codes;Task analysis;Servers;Security;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To identify when the venture has an incentive to raise funds through an ICO, we compare it with traditional bank financing and analyze the venture’s preference between the two financing options. The results show that when demand uncertainty is high, an ICO can provide both financing and information benefits, whereas when demand uncertainty is low, although the venture does not collect information through an ICO, it can still get financing benefit. Only when demand uncertainty is intermediate, the venture prefers bank financing. In addition, we find that although the revenue sharing effect of the ICO results in an underinvestment issue, it can also alleviate the loss caused by the increased cost of production.

Along with general information about the public, these platforms hold an ample amount of content related to depressed users and thus can generate sensitive social signals indicating if a person is suffering from some serious issues, such as self-harm, suicidal thoughts, or intention for an unlawful act. Early depression detection using advanced natural language processing (NLP), deep machine learning, and transfer learning techniques can assist in designing an efficient system to detect major depressive systems at an early stage. The current depression detection models are not enough to capture sensitive social signals indicating the true mood, personality, and behavior of an individual. Thus, making the current systems unsatisfactory. To address this life-threatening human-health problem, we propose an efficient artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL)-based model for identifying depressed individuals on social media platforms. The model employs hybrid feature-based behavioral-biometric signals captured using Word2Vec, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) models to learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) models. The data are captured from multiple sources using advanced crawling strategies to have data variety in the corpus. Thus, making the proposed system effective across platforms. The Dataset produced by this study is the first of its kind with a variety of depressive signals from online social network (OSN) platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The experiments have shown that both DL models LSTM and CNN, and the hybrid (CNN  $+$  LSTM) models achieved promising results on all individual as well as combined datasets. Out of 24 experiments for Word2Vec LSTM and Word2Vec (CNN  $+$  LSTM) models, we achieved the accuracy of 99.02% and 99.01%, respectively, and recorded as best results outperforming all the existing approaches on performance measures such as recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score.

However, a dozen years of PEKS development is accompanied by some security and privacy issues in the encrypted data search and access processes. The keyword guessing attack is a typical user privacy threat model, that is, an adversary could guess the user’s retrieval keyword given a search trapdoor. On the other hand, the emergence of quantum computers make traditional PEKS schemes no longer secure. Although scholars put forward some postquantum secure PEKS schemes, these schemes are based on lattice cryptography with a larger key size. To the best of our knowledge, there is no quantum-resist PEKS scheme established on elliptic curve cryptography. This article utilizes PEKS with designated tester primitive and quantum resistance of isogeny. Then, we put forward a postquantum searchable encryption scheme named Isoga, which fights against keyword guessing attacks. We prove Isoga’s searchable ciphertext security and trapdoor indistinguishability under isogeny-related difficult assumptions.

However, large numbers of unknown protocols exist in IIoT, threatening the security of IIoT devices and systems. Protocol reverse engineering extracts the grammar and semantics of the protocol by monitoring and analyzing the traffic trace or the execution process of instructions, without the need for protocol description. As the executable programs are mainly integrated into the IIoT devices and the communication traffic is relatively sparse, the traditional protocol analyzing method is not suitable for the IIoT environment. This paper proposes an improved sparse protocol parsing method of IIoT protocol based on the BPSO-vote-HMM hybrid model. The binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced to expand the captured IIoT protocol message sequence, solving the problems of sparse samples in IIoT and the low efficiency of the GA-based data expansion model. Besides, we improve on the parameter training part to improve the efficiency and get better model parameters by dividing the training set into several sub-sets, conducting the parameter update parallel, and inputting the results into a voter to generate the final parameter of HMM, which is used in protocol field prediction. Finally, by combining the BPSO-based data expansion model and the protocol field parsing model based on vote-HMM, a hybrid analytical model is constructed to improve the analytical accuracy in a gradual evolutionary manner. Through a series of comparative experiments, the improved protocol field parsing model has better performance on IIoT protocol.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2022.3184751","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:M21029); Yunnan Key Laboratory of Blockchain Application Technology(grant numbers:2021105AG070005,YNB202102); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800302); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9861388","Industrial Internet of Things;protocol inference;binary particle swarm optimization;hidden Markov model","Protocols;Hidden Markov models;Industrial Internet of Things;Analytical models;Data models;Reverse engineering;Industrial control","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

ML algorithms now find numerous applications in autonomous navigation, spacecraft health monitoring and operational management of satellite constellations. However, a large number of surveys on the applications of AI in space missions can be classified into two categories. The first category suffers from the limitation of being old and not covering some crucial and recent developments in the field; such as the contributions of Deep Learning (DL) and bioinspired AI algorithms. The challenge with the second category lies in its being too detailed with respect to the development and application of specific AI techniques or algorithms. These limitations have necessitated the need to have a concise survey with a wider scope for those interested in the applications and challenges of AI in the space industry, especially those with technical backgrounds in other fields. In this paper, we surveyed the use of traditional AI techniques in various domains of space missions without delving into formal methods. Some bioinspired AI algorithms were also surveyed and their potential application areas highlighted. Unlike similar surveys that focus only on technological challenges, we also addressed some crucial legal drawbacks that emanate from the reliance and use of AI in space. Summarily, while discussing future directions we reviewed some advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technologies. Our review prioritized three application domains positioned to benefit immensely from the inevitable AI-Blockchain convergence in the space community.

The PIWS protocol can privately calculate the intersection of identity index sets maintained by each participant and can privately calculate the weighted sum of the data associated with the identity indexes of the intersection set. After the execution of the protocol, both parties can only know the weighted sum, but not any additional information, such as any identity index or associated data of the other party. The PIWS protocol is very suitable for the privacy-preserving weighted voting scenarios and has three novel characteristics. First, it does not require as many semitrusted tally clerks as other protocols, which greatly reduces the deployment, communication, and calculation costs involved. It only requires the distributed deployment of voting servers and weight servers that are honest but curious. This is consistent with the deployment framework of the future big data application backgrounds. Second, perfect privacy protection and ballot secrecy are achieved. That is, the voting terminal or polling station provides encryption services for ballots immediately after each ballot is cast. All voting information is then expressed in ciphertext throughout the weighting and counting processes, until the final result of the weighted vote is passed to the voting server in the ciphertext. After decryption, the voting server only knows the results of the voting and it has no knowledge of the content or preference of the ballots, the privacy of the voters, or even the process of counting the votes. This design avoids the disclosure of voter privacy and ballot information, and the ciphertext form also prevents malicious users from cheating or tampering with voter or ballot information during the counting process. To better explain the security of our protocol, we present the provable security of the protocol under the honest-but-curious model and show the formal verification obtained using the Tamarin prover software. Third, our protocol not only achieves the function of an optional weighted voting protocol but also is relatively lightweight and efficient. The efficiency analysis results of the deployed voting system in terms of communication, storage, and calculation show that the protocol meets the requirements applicable to real-world applications. In summary, PIWS is superior to existing voting protocols in terms of function, security, and efficiency, and can be harmoniously applied to model updating of federated learning, consensus building of blockchain systems, or decision-making in artificial intelligence.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3162869","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172405,61872381); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission(grant numbers:Z191100007119006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756417","Perfect ballot secrecy;privacy intersection protocol;provable security;Tamarin;weighted voting protocol.","Protocols;Privacy;Servers;Decision making;Indexes;Electronic voting;Costs","","","","","","","IEEE","12 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, current understanding about this is quite limited, with previous work being largely fragmented and limited both in terms of technologies as well as their interrelationships with the triple bottom line of sustainability perspectives. The focus of this article is therefore on addressing these gaps by proposing a comprehensive multi-dimensional Construction 4.0 sustainability framework that identifies and categorizes the key Construction 4.0 technologies and their positive and negative impacts on environmental, economic, and social sustainability, and then establishing its applicability/usefulness through an empirical, multimethodology case study assessment of the UAE's construction sector. The findings indicate Construction 4.0’s positive impacts on environmental and economic sustainability that far outweigh its negative effects, although these impacts are comparable with regards to social sustainability. On Construction 4.0 technologies itself, their application was found to be nonuniform with greater application seen for building information modeling and automation vis-à-vis others such as cyber-physical systems and smart materials, with significant growth expected in the future for blockchain- and three-dimensional-printing-related technologies.

We try to reveal the value of metaverse via two academic resources, attention economy and media theory, and describe the principle of value creation in metaverse economy. To better examine how the value of NFT projects is affected by human time and attention devoted to metaverse, we first study systems with structured rules, e.g., blockchain games, to measure the players’ time spent and to quantify the players’ rewards. In addition, we investigate systems without dominant rules, in which the value of the NFTs relies more on users’ subjective valuation of their community symbols. Two representative projects, Aavegotchi and Bored Ape Yacht Club, are examined as cases of the above two scenarios. We analyze the data of NFTs such as price, time devoted, and the number of likes and acquire some meaningful findings of how NFTs drive prices up. Building on the above researches, we consider NFT systems as partly attention economy fused with finance and propose a theory of physical products combined with NFT collections to help set the value anchor of early metaverse. This will have profound implications for areas of economy such as pricing theory.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3221669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964099","Attention economy;metaverse;NFT;value","Metaverse;Economics;Media;Industries;Affordances;Internet;Games","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Integrating public transportation into the metaverse could improve services and collect user data. This study introduces a hybrid decision-making framework for prioritizing sustainable public transportation in Metaverse under q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) context. In this regard, firstly q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) generalized Dombi weighted aggregation operators (AOs) and their characteristics are developed to aggregate the q-ROF information. Second, a q-ROF information-based method using the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) and stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) models are proposed to find the objective and subjective weights of criteria, respectively. Then, a combined weighting model is taken to determine the final weights of the criteria. Third, the weighted sum product (WISP) method is extended to q-ROFS context by considering the double normalization procedures, the proposed operators and integrated weighting model. This method has taken the advantages of two normalization processes and four utility measures that approve the effect of benefit and cost criteria by using weighted sum and weighted product models. Next, to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the presented method, a case study of sustainable public transportation in metaverse is presented in the context of q-ROFSs. The findings of this study confirms that the proposed model can recommend more feasible performance while facing numerous influencing factors and input uncertainties, and thus, provides a wider range of applications","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2022.3190613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9829318","Metaverse;Sustainable public transport;Q-rung orthopair fuzzy set;Generalized Dombi operators;MEREC;SWARA;WISP","Metaverse;Public transportation;Fuzzy sets;Weight measurement;Decision making;Costs;Context modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firms’ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firms’ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario “picking the low-hanging fruit,” other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario “experiencing an era of dichotomy.” In the long-term scenario “overcoming the obstacles of the generational shift,” MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the experts’ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3137009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714458","COVID-19;Delphi;freight transportation;judgmental forecasting;maritime;scenarios;technology foresight","Containers;Supply chains;COVID-19;Uncertainty;Planning;Pandemics;Industries;Bibliographies","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As the size of financial transaction data continues to grow, traditional machine-learning models are increasingly difficult to use for financial fraud detection. Some graph-learning methods have been widely used for Internet financial fraud detection, however, these methods ignore the stronger structural homogeneity and cannot aggregate features for two structurally similar but distant nodes. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a graph-learning algorithm TA-Struc2Vec for Internet financial fraud detection, which can learn topological features and transaction amount features in a financial transaction network graph and represent them as low-dimensional dense vectors, allowing intelligent and efficient classification and prediction by training classifier models.

Technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain facilitate more robust supply chain operations, such as remanufacturing, just-in-time production, and automated workflow, leading to corporate sustainability along economic, environmental, and social dimensions. From a dynamic capability perspective, this article conceptualizes emerging IT capability and investigates its role in helping enterprises survive supply chain disruptions and prosper in the long run. A research model depicts the relationships among environmental uncertainty, supply chain vulnerability vigilance, emerging IT capability, supply chain resilience, and corporate sustainability. A partial least square analysis on survey observations collected from more than 200 enterprises in China that are highly susceptible to supply chain disruptions provides supporting evidence to most research hypotheses. The results show that high vigilance to potential supply chain disruptions will motivate enterprises to develop emerging IT capability, which will enhance supply chain resilience as well as economic, environmental, and social performances. The mediating role of emerging IT capability suggests a viable path for enterprises to adapt to the increasingly turbulent environment and improve supply chain resilience and corporate sustainability.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2022.3209613","National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:20BGL045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916158","Corporate sustainability;emerging IT capability;environmental uncertainty;supply chain (SC) resilience;SC vulnerability vigilance","Organizations;Resilience;Sustainable development;Supply chains;Dynamic scheduling;Technological innovation;Buildings","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
