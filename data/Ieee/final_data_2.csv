1,1,A Blockchain-based Model Migration Approach for Secure and Sustainable Federated Learning in IoT Systems,C. Zhang; Y. Xu; H. Elahi; D. Zhang; Y. Tan; J. Chen; Y. Zhang,China,"['Hunan University', 'Umea University', 'Central South University']",2022.0,"Model migration can accelerate model convergence during federated learning on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and reduce training costs by transferring feature extractors from fast to slow devices, which, in turn, enables sustainable computing. However, malicious or lazy devices may migrate the fake models or resist sharing models for their benefit, reducing the desired efficiency and reliability of a federated learning system. To this end, this work presents a blockchain-based model migration approach for resource-constrained IoT systems. The proposed approach aims to achieve secure model migration and speed up model training while minimizing computation cost. We first develop an incentive mechanism considering the economic benefits of fast devices, which breaks the Nash equilibrium established by lazy devices and encourages capable devices to train and share models. Second, we design a clustering-based algorithm for identifying malicious devices and preventing them from defrauding incentives. Third, we use blockchain to ensure trustworthiness in model migration and incentive processes. Blockchain records the interaction between the central server and IoT devices and runs the incentive algorithm without exposing the devices’ private data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed approach can accelerate federated learning rates, reduce model training computation costs to increase sustainability, and resist malicious attacks.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3171926,,,IEEE

6,6,BPPS:Blockchain-Enabled Privacy-Preserving Scheme for Demand-Response Management in Smart Grid Environments,K. Park; J. Lee; A. K. Das; Y. Park,India,['Kyungpook National University'],2022.0,"With the ongoing revolutionary growth of the industrial Internet of Things and smart grid networks, smart grid (SG) communication has been acknowledged as a next-generation network for intelligent and efficient electric power transmission. In SG networks, smart meters (SMs) generally send requests for electricity demand to service providers (SPs), which deal with the requests for efficient energy distribution. However, SGs experience many security issues with the deployed SMs and untrusted wireless communication. To tackle these security issues, we propose a privacy-preserving authentication scheme for demand response management in SGs, called BPPS. It can resist various attacks and achieve secure mutual authentication with key agreement; moreover, it provides integrity of demand-response data using blockchain. Moreover, we perform the informal and formal (mathematical) security analysis to confirm that BPPS is secure against various attacks and achieves session key security, respectively. Furthermore, we conduct the performance and simulation analysis for SGs using NS3 and Ethereum testnet. Consequently, BPPS provides high-level security and can be applied to actual SG networks.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3163138,3.0,,IEEE
7,7,TRUCON: Blockchain-Based Trusted Data Sharing With Congestion Control in Internet of Vehicles,M. Yuan; Y. Xu; C. Zhang; Y. Tan; Y. Wang; J. Ren; Y. Zhang,China,"['Central South University', 'Zhejiang University', 'Hunan University', 'Tsinghua University']",2022.0,"The Internet of vehicles (IoV) has a substantial impact on traffic efficiency improvement and accidents avoidance. Due to restricted resources, vehicles must share observed data with RSUs and other vehicles to execute some time-tolerant computing tasks. However, data provided by vehicles cannot always be trusted due to the presence of attackers. Fake messages could have catastrophic ramifications, such as vehicle collisions. Furthermore, extensive data sharing might cause channel congestion, resulting in the loss of vital messages during delivery. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we propose TRUCON, a blockchain-based trusted data sharing mechanism with congestion control in IoV. Firstly, we propose a Kademlia algorithm-based traffic data forwarding method to control channel congestion state. By adjusting the bucket size and distance threshold, source vehicles can limit the number of reference vehicles forwarded. Secondly, we present a cuckoo filter-based traffic data deduplication and discrimination approach. To avoid repetitive sharing, vehicles and RSUs can check their local filters to verify if the current data report has been shared. Based on the foregoing, we propose a blockchain-based trust management mechanism with congestion control. RSUs serve as full nodes while vehicles are light nodes in the blockchain. Finally, we develop a trust management prototype system with congestion control that incorporates both on-chain and off-chain parts. It signifies that our scheme is both feasible and effective.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3226500,,,IEEE

Yu,Japan,"['Xidian University', 'Manchester Metropolitan University', 'Taif University', 'Hubei University of Arts and Science', 'Hosei University']",2022.0,"As an important carrier of healthcare data, Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) generated from various sensors, i.e., wearable, implantable, are extremely valuable research materials for artificial intelligence and machine learning.

However, in traditional centralized data sharing architectures, the balance between privacy and traceability still cannot be well handled. To address the issue that malicious users cannot be locked in the fully anonymous sharing schemes, we propose a trackable anonymous remote healthcare data storing and sharing scheme over decentralized consortium blockchain. Through an “on-chain & off-chain” model, it relieves the massive data storage pressure of medical blockchain. By introducing an improved proxy re-encryption mechanism, the proposed scheme realizes the fine-gained access control of the outsourced data, and can also prevent the collusion between semi-trusted cloud servers and data requestors who try to reveal EMRs without authorization.

10,10,Secure and Efficiently Searchable IoT Communication Data Management Model: Using Blockchain as a new tool,H. Zhang; X. Zhang; Z. Guo; H. Wang; D. Cui; Q. Wen,China,['Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications'],2021.0,"With the rapid development of the Internet of things (IoT), more IoT devices are connected in the same network and communicate frequently for sharing data and switching instructions. So that the traditional centralized security architecture of IoT will be limited in terms of data storage space, data reliability, scalability and operating costs. In this paper, we propose a novel communication data management model based on blockchain technology. Specifically, all encrypted IoT communication data files are uploaded to public cloud server for obtaining enough storage space, but the key information extracted from these data files (called ""communication logs"") will be recorded in an ""IoT ledger"" maintained by all IoT devices. In fact, the IoT ledger is a kind of blockchain structured distributed database, which can solve the problem of data reliability, scalability and would not involve high operating costs. Besides, in order to efficiently search communication logs and not reveal any sensitive information of communication data, we design a secure search scheme over such blockchain database, the asymmetric scalar-product preserving encryption (ASPE) approach is exploited to guarantee the data security, and the two layers index improves the search efficiency. Security analysis and experiments on synthetic dataset show that our scheme is secure and efficient.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3121482,,,IEEE

To tackle the above challenges, we propose a secure and trusted federated data sharing (STFS) based on blockchain. Initially, we construct an autonomous and reliable federated extreme gradient boosting learning algorithm to crack the data isolation problem, providing privacy protection and verifiability. Furthermore, we design a secure and trusted data sharing and trading mechanism to ensure secure on-demand controlled data sharing and fair trading.

However, with the rapid data generation in the IIoT environment, the topology scale of DAG-blockchain will increase sharply, which will aggravate the data storage cost of blockchain nodes. In this article, to reduce the data storage cost of edge servers, we design a Graphpartition based storage strategy for DAG-Blockchain (GpDB), equipped with a graph partition algorithm based on transaction freshness, which can partition DAG-blockchain topology in edge servers into two parts, which will be retained and removed respectively. Simulation shows that, in terms of storage cost, GpDB outperforms LDV and Layerchain by 62% and 74% respectively, and with the increasing number of transactions, GpDB has good scalability in reducing the storage cost, and better transaction throughput than IOTA.",1941-0050,,10.1109/TII.2022.3162201,,,IEEE

Chen,China,['Sichuan University'],2021.0,"With the development of big data and blockchain, an increasing number of scholars have begun to study blockchain for data sharing. By studying data sharing models that are based on blockchain, we find that almost all of them have the following problems: 1). It is difficult to protect the privacy and integrity of users’ data, along with users’ data ownership. 2). The storage burden of blockchain is heavy, and blockchain lacks a mechanism for dealing with data with diverse types and inconsistent formats. 3). The consensus mechanism has low fairness or low efficiency. Therefore, we propose a data sharing privacy protection model (DS2PM) that is based on blockchain and a federated learning mechanism for solving these problems. The safety analysis and experimental results show that the DS2PM outperforms the previously established schemes.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3134755,2.0,,IEEE

Yu,China,"['Shandong University', 'Zhejiang Gongshang University', 'Shaanxi Normal University']",2021.0,"Blockchain systems face two emergent problems, namely scalability and privacy, each of which has been addressed independently. However, how to achieve privacy and scalability simultaneously remains a challenging problem for blockchains. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving and scalable permissioned blockchain system called HyperMaze employing the zero knowledge proof technique and a hierarchical system architecture. It gains scalability by adopting a hierarchy of multiple blockchains that processes transactions in parallel. We design an ID-based dual-balance account model where an identity-based account is associated with two types of balancesa plaintext balance and a private (zero-knowledge) balance. Furthermore, we design a two-phase cross-chain transaction mechanism (2PXT) to achieve transaction privacy for both intra-chain and cross-chain transactions. We rigorously formulate a security model for HyperMaze under the universal composability framework, and then provide a simulation-based security proof. A prototype of HyperMaze is implemented and a series of experiments are conducted over up to 2,600 nodes to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that a 4-level, (7,10)-threshold, 6-ary HyperMaze system can reach 19,440 TPS and the transaction confirmation latency is only 9.5 seconds. To our best knowledge, HyperMaze is the first high-throughput privacy-preserving blockchain whose throughput is over 19,000 TPS.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2021.3133840,,,IEEE

46,46,Toward On-Device Federated Learning: A Direct Acyclic Graph-Based Blockchain Approach,M. Cao; L. Zhang; B. Cao,China,"['Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications', 'University of Electronic Science and Technology of China']",2021.0,"Due to the distributed characteristics of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability of the global model and the coordination of devices are the main obstacle. As a promising solution of decentralization, scalability, and security, leveraging the blockchain in FL has attracted much attention in recent years. However, the traditional consensus mechanisms designed for blockchain-like proof of work (PoW) would cause extreme resource consumption, which reduces the efficiency of FL greatly, especially when the participating devices are wireless and resource-limited. In order to address device asynchrony and anomaly detection in FL while avoiding the extra resource consumption caused by blockchain, this article introduces a framework for empowering FL using direct acyclic graph (DAG)-based blockchain systematically (DAG-FL). Accordingly, DAG-FL is first introduced from a three-layer architecture in detail, and then, two algorithms DAG-FL Controlling and DAG-FL Updating are designed running on different nodes to elaborate the operation of the DAG-FL consensus mechanism. After that, a Poisson process model is formulated to discuss that how to set deployment parameters to maintain DAG-FL stably in different FL tasks. The extensive simulations and experiments show that DAG-FL can achieve better performance in terms of training efficiency and model accuracy compared with the typical existing on-device FL systems as the benchmarks.",2162-2388,,10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3105810,5.0,,IEEE

Wang,China,"['Tianjin University', 'University of Houston', 'email zhan2uhedu Tianjin University']",2021.0,"In a public blockchain system applying Proof of Work (PoW), the participants need to compete with their computing resources for reward, which is challenging for resource-limited devices. Mobile blockchain is proposed to facilitate the application of blockchain for mobile service, in which the lightweight devices can participate mining by renting resources from the Cloud Computing Service Provider (CCSP), but CCSP usually does not have the information about the demand preference of users. In this paper, a contract model is adopted to address the cloud computing resource allocation and pricing problem in the mobile blockchain. In particular, an adverse selection contract solution is proposed to overcome the information asymmetry problem, and resource pooling is introduced to improve the stability of users rewards. Simulation results show that the information asymmetry problem is well overcome by adverse selection contract so that CCSP can obtain more utility than linear pricing contracts. Furthermore, the resource pooling could effectively improve the users and CCSPs utilities. When the size of the mining pool is large enough, it can achieve an improvement effect of more than 10 times.

You,China,['Southeast University'],2021.0,"Recently, blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) arises as an innovative paradigm for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications to build cooperative trust, aggregate wireless resources, and schedule inter-and intra-network tasks among independent network entities. It establishes an open platform based on blockchain to provide diverse wireless services and applications, such as radio access, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile edge computing, via trusted interactions with enhanced security and efficiency. As a distinctive feature, B-RAN enables secure and efficient resource sharing and trading by aggregating, pooling, and coordinating resources from multiple resource hosts and owners across subnetworks. Therefore, an implementable architecture along with various functional modules shall be delicately designed. This work aims to establish a unified architecture with enhanced efficiency, security, compatibility, and flexibility for resource sharing and trading in B-RAN. Specifically, we develop a six-layer architecture that incorporates a number of novel features such as enhanced blockchain structures, secure interaction methods, efficient service mechanisms, and scalable transaction patterns. We design a number of pluggable functional modules in each layer to support diverse functions, services, and applications of resource sharing and trading. At last, we implement a practical prototype based on the layered architecture for resource-limited devices. Multiple experiments are presented to verify the performance of the proposed architecture from different aspects.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3135414,3.0,,IEEE

Wang,China,"['Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications', 'Shanghai University', 'Najran University', 'Xian JiaotongLiverpool University']",2022.0,"Blockchain can help edge IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) in solving its privacy and security problems. In this paper, a lightweight blockchain called LBlockchainE is designed for edge IoT-enabled MTS to guarantee the security of sensor data stored in an edge computing environment. To save the resources of edge servers on ship, a data placement strategy is proposed. To encourage edge servers to positively contribute to storing data generated by sensor devices, storage resource consumption is employed as an influencing parameter, and servers with abundant resources are selected for priority storage. The data placement strategy also takes care of the access delay between servers and selects the nodes with the least access and storage costs as the priority storage choice. LBlockchainE applies the low-energy-consumption characteristics of Proof of Stake to determine the ownership of bookkeeping rights through a small number of competitive calculations and the resources of the node. Experimental results indicate that compared with Ethereum, the consensus mechanism of LBlockchainE consumes less energy and occupies less storage space. On average, the new system uses 1.6% less time and consumes 78% less battery power compared with traditional blockchain systems. In comparison to the random storage, the best storage, and the optimal data storage strategies, the proposed strategy maintains the same message costs.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3157447,1.0,,IEEE

Khalil,Australia,['RMIT University'],2022.0,"Industry 4.0 is all about doing things in a concurrent, secure, and fine-grained manner. IoT edge-sensors and their associated data play a predominant role in today’s industry ecosystem. Breaching data or forging source devices after injecting advanced persistent threats (APT) damages the industry owners’ money and loss of operators’ lives. The existing challenges include APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. Edgeservers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which in essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers while transporting data using traditional PKI-rendered trusts, consortium blockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning, edge devices can filter malicious data at their end which largely motivates us to institute a Blockchain and AI aligned APT detection system. The unique contributions of the paper include efficient APT detection at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boost trust among collaborators and ensure an economical and sustainable mechanism after eliminating existing certificate authority. Finally, the edge-compliant storage technique facilitates efficient predictive maintenance.

Cui,Australia,"['Shandong University', 'Murdoch University']",2022.0,"The Internet-of-Things enables interconnection of billions of devices, which perform autonomous operations and collect various types of data. These things, along with their generated huge amount of data, need to be handled efficiently and securely. Centralized solutions are not desired due to security concerns and scalability issue. In this paper, we propose HIBEChain, a hierarchical blockchain system that realizes scalable and accountable management of IoT devices and data. HIBEChain consists of multiple permissioned blockchains that form a hierarchical tree structure. To support the hierarchical structure of HIBEChain, we design a decentralized hierarchical identity-based signature (DHIBS) scheme, which enables IoT devices to use their identities as public keys. Consequently, HIBEChain achieves high scalability through parallel processing as blockchain sharding schemes, and it also implements accountability by use of identity-base keys. Identity-based keys not only make HIBEChain more user-friendly, they also allow private key recovery by validators when necessary. We provide detailed analysis of its security and performance, and implement HIBEChain based on Ethereum source code. Experiment results show that a 6-ary, (7,10)-threshold, 4-level HIBEChain can achieve 32,000 TPS, and it needs only 9 seconds to confirm a transaction.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3152797,,,IEEE

90,90,PartitionChain: A Scalable and Reliable Data Storage Strategy for Permissioned Blockchain,Z. Du; H. -f. Qian; X. Pang,China,['East China Normal University'],2021.0,"Blockchain technology has aroused wide interests and become a hot topic in the real world. Nevertheless, the increasingly heavy storage consumption brought by the full-replication data storage mechanism, becomes a bottleneck to the system scalability. To address this problem, a reliable storage scheme named BFT-Store, integrating erasure coding with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), was proposed recently. While, three critical problems are still left open: (i) The complex re-initialization process of the blockchain when the number of nodes varies; (ii) The high computational overload of downloading data; (iii) The massive communication on the network. This paper proposes a blockchain storage scheme termed PartitionChain which addresses the above three problems, maintaining the merits of BFT-Store. Firstly, our scheme allows the original nodes to merely update a single aggregate signature in the re-initialization. Secondly, the computational complexity of retrieving data by decoding is greatly reduced. Thirdly, the amount of transmitted data for recovering data is reduced from O(n) (assuming n is the number of nodes) to O(1). Furthermore, this paper introduces a reputation ranking system where the malicious behaviors of the nodes can be detected, enabling PartitionChain to expel the nodes with misbehavior to the specific extent.",1558-2191,,10.1109/TKDE.2021.3136556,,,IEEE
91,91,Privacy Protection Data Retrieval Scheme with Inverted Index for IoT based on Blockchain,W. Li; Y. Chen; F. Gao; S. Zhang; H. Zhang; Q. Wen,China,['Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications'],2021.0,"In the 6G era, Internet of things (IoT) devices can form a blockchain network, which also faces the problems of data sharing. And the data transmitted and stored through the network has the risk of privacy leaking. Encrypting the shared data can satisfy the need of the privacy, and retrieving the encrypted data can make the data used efficiently.However, to enable users to retrieve encrypted data and perform fine-grained authorization on their encrypted files is still a great challenge. Although attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) is a well-received solution to the challenge, there are still privacy and efficiency issues if the traditional ABKS schemes are directly used in blockchain data sharing. In order to solve the problems, this paper proposes privacy protection data retrieval scheme with an inverted index which is an application of attribute-based encryption. Firstly, our scheme is proved secure against the outside keyword guessing attack (KGA) and chosen keyword attack (CKA) under semi-trusted model. Secondly, the scheme returns a multi-keywords ranked result. Thirdly, we analyze the efficiency of our scheme, and verify it by simulation.The results show that our scheme has improvement in efficiency and can meet the data sharing needs of the blockchain network composed of IoT devices.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3128528,,,IEEE

96,96,Energy-Efficient and Physical Layer Secure Computation Offloading in Blockchain-Empowered Internet of Things,Y. Liu; Z. Su; Y. Wang,China,['Xi’an Jiaotong University'],2022.0,"This paper investigates computation offloading in blockchain-empowered Internet of Things (IoT), where the task data uploading link from sensors to a base station (BS) is protected by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted physical layer security (PLS). After receiving task data, the BS allocates computational resources provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to help sensors perform tasks. Existing blockchain-based computation offloading schemes usually focus on network performance improvements, such as energy consumption minimization or latency minimization, and neglect the Gas fee for computation offloading, resulting in the dissatisfaction of high Gas providers. Also, the secrecy rate during the data uploading process can not be measured by a steady value because of the time-varying characteristics of IRS-based wireless channels, thereby computational resources allocation with a secrecy rate measured before data uploading is inappropriate. In this paper, we design a Gas-oriented computation offloading scheme that guarantees a low degree of dissatisfaction of sensors, while reducing energy consumption. Also, we deduce the ergodic secrecy rate of IRS-assisted PLS transmission that can represent the global secrecy performance to allocate computational resources. The simulations show that the proposed scheme has lower energy consumption compared to existing schemes, and ensures that the node paying higher Gas gets stronger computational resources.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3159248,5.0,,IEEE

Cliff,China,['Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications'],2022.0,"The emergence of edge computing makes it possible to realize new technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality. However, a large number of devices and more messages at the edge bring more security problems. Therefore, it is an important research topic to provide users with faster network services while ensuring confidentiality and authentication of data transmission. Because signcryption can encrypt and sign messages at the same time, it has become a new cryptographic primitive. In the meantime, certificateless signcryption guarantees data confidentiality and authentication and addresses traditional single point failure problems based on the trust center and the problem of relying on a trusted third party. Therefore, certificateless signcryption has attracted great attention from academia and industry. But certificateless signcryption also faces two types of attacks. In order to more effectively resist these two types of attacks, we propose a certificateless signcryption mechanism based on blockchain. This mechanism can make good use of the nontamperable feature of blockchain, prevent illegal users from substituting public key of the user, and guarantee signature non-repudiation. And our scheme is investigated in a comparative study with eight schemes. Comparative analysis outcomes demonstrate our scheme has achieved better results in efficiency and security.

As a new data sharing technology with intelligence and privacy computing, federated learning receives wide attention. It can realize data value delivery and data privacy protection at the same time, however, it lacks supervision in the application process, and the reliability of calculation process and result transmission cannot be guaranteed. As a distributed ledger technology, blockchain has the trust property but lacks computing power. Therefore, we propose to extend the computing and supervision capabilities of blockchain with state channel, using state channel to create sandboxes and instantiate federated learning tasks in order to realize the trust supervision mechanism based on sandboxes. In this paper, we establish a federated learning based distributed data sharing architecture and on the basis of the architecture we design a state channel based distributed data sharing trust supervision mechanism.

121,121,A Numerical Splitting and Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation Based LDP Mechanism for Privacy Preservation in Blockchain-Powered IoT,K. Zhang; J. Tian; H. Xiao; Y. Zhao; W. Zhao; J. Chen,Australia,['Swinburne University of Technology'],2022.0,"Blockchain has gradually attracted widespread attention from the research community of the IoT, due to its decentralization, consistency, and other attributes. It builds a secure and robust system by generating a backup locally for each participant node to collectively maintain the network. However, this feature brings some privacy concerns since all nodes can access the chain data, users' sensitive information under risk of leakage. The local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism can be a promising way to address this issue as it implements data perturbation before uploading to the chain. While traditional LDP mechanisms cannot fit well with blockchain since the requirements of a fixed input range, large data volume, and using the same privacy budget, which are practically difficult in a decentralized environment. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel LDP mechanism to split input numerical data and implement perturbation by digital bits, which does not require a fixed input range and large data volume. In addition, we use an iteration approach to adaptively allocate the privacy budget for different perturbation procedures that minimize the total deviation of perturbed data and increase the data utility. We employ mean estimation as the statistical utility metric under the same and randomized privacy budgets to evaluate the performance of our novel LDP mechanism. The experiment results indicate that the proposed LDP mechanism performs better in different scenarios, and our adaptive privacy budget allocation model can significantly reduce the deviation of perturbation function to provide high data utility while maintaining privacy.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3145845,,,IEEE

This integration with end users produces large-scale and heterogeneous data sources that demand machine learning (ML)-based data analytics for decision-making and to provide security against ML and data privacy attacks. The development of privacy-aware ML models within a federated learning (FL) ecosystem can empower an entire network to learn from data in a decentralized manner. In this article, we propose a differentially privacy blockchain-based explainable FL (DP-BFL) framework by harnessing the ever-evolving power of SM 3.0 networks. This framework permits any Internet empowered device to partake and contribute data to a global privacy preserved model. In this framework, participants will upload the differentially private local updates to the miners of blockchain, where the local updates will be evaluated and rewarded. The experimental results obtained from real-world datasets, namely, SM 3.0 and MNIST, demonstrated that the proposed framework could achieve high utility, enhanced privacy, and elevated efficiency.

First, our proposed DP-BFL yields noticeable performance improvements in the applied learning models with high privacy and comparable utility levels, in terms of accuracy and f-measure metrics, to a standard FL and centralized learning approaches under the restriction of privacy preservation. Second, given a certain number of the malicious entities, DP-BFL allowed an enhanced recognition of users' preferences in the SM 3.0 dataset and precise prediction of images' class in the MNIST dataset while mitigating the impact of the malicious entities' poisoned updates.

153,153,EBCPA: Efficient Blockchain-based Conditional Privacy-preserving Authentication for VANETs,C. Lin; X. Huang; D. He,China,"['Fujian Normal University', 'Wuhan University']",2022.0,"Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are with great potentials to facilitate traffic management and improve driver safety. Blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (BCPPA) is proposed to achieve an optimal tradeoff among anonymity, traceability and key/certificate management in VANETs. Existing BCPPA protocols mitigate these security and privacy challenges by adding a significant cost on verification and traceability. As a result, current solutions fail to meet high mobility, low latency, and real-time requirements of VANETs. In this paper, we design three new system building blocks namely key derivation (KeyDer), signatures of knowledge (SoK) and smart contract, following by a more efficient BCPPA protocol (named as EBCPA). To show the advantage of EBCPA, we first demonstrate it can satisfy the necessary requirements (e.g. message authentication, conditional privacy protection, resilience to common attacks, and so forth). Moreover, we implement the EBCPA in the on-line Ethereum test network (Rinkeby), Hyperledger test network and VANETs simulation environment (via VanetMobiSim and NS-2). Finally, we evaluate its communication overhead and computational cost via comparing to existing BCPPA protocols that strive to achieve similar properties. From the implementation and comparison results, our proposal can improve efficiency by reducing the time cost of traceability at least 48.95% and verification at least 42.21%.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3164740,1.0,,IEEE

Luo,China,"['Sun YatSen University', 'The Hong Kong Polytechnic University']",2021.0,"Payment channel, which allows two parties to perform micropayments without involving the blockchain, has become a promising proposal to improve the scalability of decentralized ledgers. Payment channels have been extended to payment networks to utilize existing channels as intermediary links to route coins to others. However, payments through multiple channels bear nontrivial overheads, including time cost, charges at intermediate nodes, etc. In this paper, we propose channel hub, a novel off-chain system to shorten the routing path for the payment network. Channel hub allows transferring coins directly from one payment channel to another within the same hub, so that it can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment network. Compared with payment hub in literature, which connects participant nodes, our channel hub is more efficient and lightweight, because it connects channels already constructed by the payment network. Based on channel hub, we design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain cross-channel transfers.

Providers forward transactions to collectors; collectors upload received transactions to governors after verifying and labeling them; and governors validate a portion of the labeled transactions they receive, pack valid transactions into a block, and append the block to the ledger. This model has various fields of application including data collection from the Internet-of-Things and second-hand markets. Our main contribution is to propose a reputation-based protocol to help governors evaluate the reliability of collectors. Specifically, given a transaction, each governor runs a softmax-based function to calculate a probability for each collector that sent and labeled this transaction. The probabilities, calculated using collectors' reputations as inputs, represent the likelihood of the lead governor selecting the labeled transaction from collectors to consider for further validation. After the lead governor verifies a transaction, all collectors' reputations are updated in line with the agreement of their labeling and the validity of the transaction as found by the lead governor. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our protocol can significantly reduce governors' verification workloads while maintaining firm liveness and high incentives.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2021.3130244,1.0,,IEEE

However, federated learning systems struggle to achieve trustworthiness and embody responsible AI principles. In particular, federated learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to multi-stakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To enhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture. We first design a smart contract-based data-model provenance registry to enable accountability. Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm to enhance fairness in training data.

However, existing access control solutions are not generally lightweight or scalable, particularly for geographically disperse, inexpensive resource constrained IoT devices. To tackle above challenges, we propose a lightweight consortium blockchain based architecture to enable intelligent autonomous access control for IoT devices. In our architecture, intelligent blockchain facilitates the storing of access policies, provision of authentication services for data access control, and trust evaluation for access request nodes through token accumulation mechanism.

The digitization of medical certificates and documents leads to potential security issues, such as forging of certificates risk the privacy of healthcare documents. Moreover, individuals still need to be physically present and wait at the issuing healthcare centers to get the certificates. Currently, the infrastructure of any healthcare industry connects the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and application software that communicates with the Information Technology (IT) systems. Blockchain technology with IoT can significantly affect the healthcare industry by improving efficiency, security, transparency, and can provide more business opportunities. Therefore, a privacy-preserving technique has been proposed in this paper for IoT-based healthcare systems using blockchain technology. The proposed architecture provides an interface between the users and healthcare centers to generate and maintain health documents. Furthermore, the proposed scheme ensures security by specifying rules with a smart contract.

Jia,China,"['Beijing Normal University', 'City University of Hong Kong']",2021.0,"Electronic Health Record (EHR) and its privacy have attracted widespread attention with the development of the healthcare industry in recent years. As locking medical data in a single healthcare center causes information isolation, healthcare centers are motivated to build medical data sharing systems. However, existing systems highly rely on the trusted centralized servers, which are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and the single point of failure. Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner. In this paper, we propose MedShare, a decentralized framework for secure EHR sharing. Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR.

Different data owners control different private domains of the IoT through edge devices and hope to achieve credible data sharing. Most of the existing solutions are based on blockchain to realize cross-domain IoT data sharing. However, incremental IoT data sharing has dual requirements for the consensus mechanism to be efficient and Byzantine fault-tolerant. Independent use of the existing consensus mechanism can not meet the above requirements simultaneously. Therefore, we propose an efficient and fault-tolerant blockchain consensus transform (BCT) mechanism for IoT.

In order to study the application and development mechanism of currency products, this work investigates the practical application of digital currency products under blockchain technology at the present stage, and analyzes the potential security risks. The Artificial Immune Algorithm (AIA) is an intelligent method to imitate the function of the biological immune system, which provides a new solution for solving complex distributed problems. Firstly, a blockchain digital currency product is proposed based on AIA. Secondly, taking the credit risk of innovation risk in financial currency products as an example, the Diffie-Hellman (DH) with blockchain technology is used. Finally, the generation and optimization of the plan are realized, and an innovative risk plan is proposed for blockchain digital currency products on the basis of AIA. The results show that: (1) The improved AIA implements a guided AIA with adaptive parameter update. (2) The digital signature technology using the DH algorithm has a stronger anti-attack ability than the traditional blockchain digital signature technology. It improves the security of blockchain digital currency.

Currently, there is a lack of quantitative and comprehensive models in the literature that researchers and practitioners can use to assess healthcare organizations’ readiness for blockchain adoption, particularly from multiple perspectives and using expert judgements. Thus, the objective of this article is to develop a scoring model to evaluate healthcare organization's readiness to adopt blockchain in the context of electronic health records system management. Specifically, in this article, a literature review and expert feedback were used to identify the most important factors influencing blockchain adoption. The outcomes of the article present an identification and prioritization of the blockchain adoption impacting factors. The article identified 17 factors. These factors are grouped into five perspective: financial, social, technical, organizational, and regulations and legal. The results of the article highlight that regulation compliance, regulation uncertainty, budget availability, management support, security and privacy, and financial risk and uncertainty play an important role in the organization's readiness for blockchain adoption. The readiness scoring model then developed and evaluated through two real-world case studies at two healthcare organizations.

Sung,Taiwan,"['Takming University of Science and Technology', 'National ChinYi University of Technology']",2022.0,"In this study, blockchain technology is used to strengthen the security of wireless sensing data in the network architecture of the Internet of Things. For many organic farms that contain crops with high unit prices, the environmental parameters of the crops grown on the farm are often regarded as confidential data. First, a wireless sensing network is used to transmit sensing data to the farm’s front-end integrated microcontroller for fusion of the sensing data. After fusion of the sensing data is completed, the processed data is transmitted to the data processing center of the entire farm for encapsulation of the blockchain algorithm. Data are sent to the cloud database for storage after they are packaged by the system. At the same time, the data in the cloud database can be managed and analyzed by remote operators. Data encapsulation based on blockchain technology is used to effectively prevent any data from being stolen or destroyed by hackers. A complete blockchain encapsulation database system is implemented in the experimental stage, and the operator can use this system to encrypt the data that have been fused at the remote end for blockchain technology. In the encryption process of this blockchain, the security of data processing can be specifically enhanced by the system. Finally, each encapsulated block of data is securely stored in a private cloud database. There is a function to check whether the data in the cloud have been tampered with. A very innovative approach to using blockchain technology is proposed in this paper to enhance the security of data processing.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3199735,,,IEEE

Shi,Taiwan,"['National Taiwan University', 'Nanjing University of Science and Technology']",2022.0,"During the recent COVID-19 (CoV) global outbreak, there is a sharp decline of revenue of on-demand ride-hailing (ODR) platforms because people have serious worries of infection in the shared vehicles. Blockchain, which supports cryptocurrency and creates full traceability of the service history of each car and driver, may come to rescue by allowing the platform to offer only the “safe cars” to consumers. Motivated by the real world challenges associated with the CoV outbreak for the ODR platform, we build game-theoretical models based on the M/M/n queuing system to explore if and how blockchain can help. In the basic model, the ODR platform decides the service price and special hygiene level. Comparing between the cases with and without blockchain, we find that blockchain implementation increases both the service price and hygiene level. In addition, when the consumers’ inherent worry of infection is substantially large, implementing blockchain achieves all-win for the ODR platform, drivers and consumers. In the extended models, we first consider the case when the special hygiene level is determined by the drivers under a mixed-leadership game and then explore the case when customers are risk averse. The main findings about blockchain adoption remain valid in both cases. However, when the drivers take charge of the special hygiene level, both optimal decisions are lower in most cases. It is also important to make efforts to reduce consumers’ feeling volatility toward service valuation for improving the value of blockchain adoption and related performances.",1558-0040,,10.1109/TEM.2021.3131044,,,IEEE

247,247,The Choice Strategy of Authentication Technology for Luxury E-Commerce Platforms in the Blockchain Era,G. Li; Z. -P. Fan; X. -Y. Wu,China,['Northeastern University'],2021.0,"Blockchain technology, as an emerging information technology, has attracted much attention. Some luxury e-commerce platforms have focused on the adoption of blockchain technology to provide electronic certificates for consumers, which helps to increase consumers’ trust in luxury goods. However, due to the high authentication cost of blockchain technology, some platforms still adopt manual technology with lower authentication costs to provide paper certificates for consumers. So whether platforms choose to adopt manual technology or blockchain technology for authentication is a problem worthy of attention. In this article, we investigate the choice strategy of authentication technology for luxury e-commerce platform(s) in the monopoly and duopoly markets, respectively. The results show that the choice of authentication technology for platform(s) depends on the cost difference between manual technology authentication and blockchain technology authentication. When the cost difference is small (large), platform(s) should adopt blockchain (manual) technology. In particular, in the duopoly market, the competition between the two platforms will improve their motivation to adopt blockchain technology, but the two platforms may trap into a prisoner's dilemma when they both adopt blockchain technology. Moreover, in the monopoly and duopoly markets, adopting blockchain technology is likely to improve consumer surplus and social welfare at the same time.",1558-0040,,10.1109/TEM.2021.3076606,,,IEEE

Jurdak,Australia,['Queensland University of Technology'],2022.0,"Distribution, security, and immutability have led to the great success of blockchain in many applications, while contributing to major increases in ledger size. The storage challenge is one of the major barriers to the adoption of blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of many resource constrained devices. In this paper, we propose Multi-Level Distributed Caching (MLDC) for blockchain storage optimisation which reduces data replication based on data access patterns in a decentralised manner. For storage optimisation of data-centric blockchains, MLDC introduces a hierarchical storage class (SC), in which every node is assigned to an SC with its own Access Frequency (AF) threshold based on node availability. To reduce the number of replications shared among participant nodes, each node in a SC continues to remove unaccessed data from local storage based on a threshold time determined by the AF threshold of the SC, while maintaining all block hashes for consistency. Eventually, all nodes in MLDC store the most frequently accessed data in their local storage, so MLDC effectively reduces the storage and query costs while minimising network overhead. We also analyse the security of MLDC and quantitatively evaluate its performance for both the uniform access and exponentially decaying access patterns. The evaluation was carried out on a representative blockchain simulator with 15 storage nodes. Our results from 11 hours of experiments producing 6667 blocks and 39997 transactions show good performance for MLDC. The results of the experimentation for the exponentially decaying assess pattern show that MLDC can reduce the total storage cost by 83% compared to conventional blockchain systems, while maintaining blockchain consistency and data availability with a slight increase in network overhead and query cost.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3224735,,,IEEE

Using pyRAPL, a python library to measure the energy consumption of a computation, we experiment with both the standard and energy-reduced implementations of both algorithms for different input sizes. Our results show that up to 98% reduction in energy consumption is possible within the blockchain’s MT construction module, with the benefits typically increasing with larger input sizes. For the PoW algorithm, our results show up to 20% reduction in energy consumption, with the benefits being lower for higher difficulty levels.

The main objective of this article is to develop a blockchain solution in an attempt to mitigate corruption. The contribution details a document verification process as a solution to lessen third-party access to sensitive information and ensure that it is safe and untampered with. The solution proposed to this issue was the introduction of blockchain technology to aid in document verification. This makes the entire system decentralized and reduces the amount of third-party access to sensitive information. Using blockchain makes documents immutable thus reducing corrupt activity such as identity theft and ghost accounts. A blockchain implementation in the field of document verification also dissolves the need for certified copies, which then allows for better use of state funds and public service workers.

However, for DAG structured blockchains, it is difficult to determine the order of blocks. Additionally, there is also lack of secure and efficient ways to generate blocks in parallel. To address these problems, we propose an efficient DAG blockchain architecture. First, a novel heaviest chain rule based on the block weight is proposed to guide the selection of the parent and uncle block for a new block, which realize that appending is ordering. Second, a tree-based gossip protocol (TBGP) is proposed to improve consensus efficiency by reducing message redundancy. Furthermore, federated learning is used to select nodes constructing tree-based gossip network (TBGN).

272,272,Pooling is Not Favorable: Decentralize Mining Power of PoW Blockchain Using Age-of-Work,L. Shi; T. Wang; J. Li; S. Zhang; S. Guo,China,"['Nanjing University of Science and Technology', 'Shenzhen University', 'Hong Kong Polytechnic University']",2022.0,"As the underlying consensus protocol of Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, Proof-of-Work (PoW) features a cryptographic mathematical puzzle whose solution is easy to verify but extremely hard to solve. Under PoW, miners maintain the security of blockchain by devoting computing powers to solve the puzzle; the miner who has solved the puzzle successfully generates a block, along with a reward (e.g., a set of cryptocurrency). The average waiting time to generate a block is inversely proportional to the computing power of the miner. To reduce the average block generation time, a group of individual miners can form a centralized mining pool to aggregate their computing power to solve the puzzle together and share the reward contained in the block. However, if the aggregated computing power of the pool forms a substantial portion of the total computing power in the network, the pooled mining undermines the core spirit of blockchain, i.e., the decentralization, and harms its security. To discourage the pooled mining, we develop a new consensus protocol called Proof-of-Age (PoA) that builds upon the native PoW protocol. The core idea of PoA lies in using Age-of-Work (AoW) to measure the effective mining periods that the miners have devoted to maintaining the security of blockchain. Unlike in the native PoW protocol, in our PoA protocol, miners benefit from its effective mining periods even if they have not successfully mined a block. We first employ a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) to model the block generation process of the PoA based blockchain. Based on this CTMC model, we then analyze the block generation rates of the mining pool and solo miners respectively. Our analytical results verify that under PoA, the block generation rates of miners in the mining pool are reduced compared to that of solo miners, thereby disincentivizing the pooled mining. Finally, we simulate the mining process in the PoA blockchain to demonstrate the consistency of the analytical results.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2022.3226496,,,IEEE

Also, COVID-19 information is encrypted multiple times before transmitting to a series of nodes in the network. To ensure that COVID-19 information is successfully shared, a blockchain-based coalition system is proposed. The coalition system enables health institutions to share information while maximizing their payoffs.

Andaloussi,Morocco,['Hassan II University of Casablanca'],2022.0,"In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is facing several challenges, mainly due to the lack of personal, institutions, and medications in public health systems. Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3186945,,,IEEE

Wu,China,"['Soochow University', 'Temple University']",2022.0,"Blockchain came to prominence as the distributed ledger underneath Bitcoin, which protects the transaction histories in a fully-connected, peer-to-peer network. The blockchain mining process requires high computing power to solve a Proof-of-Work (PoW) puzzle, which is hard to implement on users’ mobile devices. So these miners may leverage the edge/cloud service providers (ESPs/CSP) to calculate the PoW puzzle. The existing edge-assisted blockchain networks assumed that all ESPs have a uniform propagation delay, which is unrealistic. In this paper, we consider a more practical scene where ESPs locate in diverse positions of the blockchain network, which causes different propagation delays when supporting the computation of the PoW puzzle. Additionally, these ESPs connect to a remote CSP for resource scheduling when the computing tasks exceed their maximum capacity. The blockchain mining process generally involves complicated competition and games among CSP, ESPs, and miners. Each service provider focuses on how to determine his resource price so that he can maximize his utility. According to the set resource price, each miner concentrates on scheduling his resource requests for each ESP to maximize individual personal utility, which depends on ESPs’ resource price and propagation delays. We first model such a resource pricing and scheduling problem as a three-stage multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game and aim at finding the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we analyze the subgame optimization problem in each stage and propose an iterative algorithm based on backward induction to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.

283,283,Accountable Attribute-Based Data Sharing Scheme Based on Blockchain for Vehicular Ad Hoc Network,Z. Guo; G. Wang; Y. Li; J. Ni; R. Du; M. Wang,China,['East China Normal University'],2022.0,"Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), as one of the bases of intelligent transport systems, plays an essential role in improving road traffic safety. Nevertheless, in such a complicated, distributed, and highly mobile network structure, how to achieve secure data sharing is a great challenge. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a potential method to realize one-to-many data sharing for VANET. However, the key abuse problems of users and attribute authorities (AAs) incur many security concerns for VANET. Both issues are extremely important because the attribute keys directly affect users’ access to shared data. To solve the above issues, we propose an accountable attribute-based data sharing scheme with blockchain technology (AT-DS-VAHN, in short). For AAs key abuse, we use the consortium blockchain maintained by AAs to achieve distributed key storage and distribution. The attribute keys generated by each AA and its key distribution records are recorded on the blockchain in the form of transactions. Based on the traceability of blockchain, the key abuse behaviour of AAs can be caught and prosecuted. For user key abuse, we achieve white-box traceability and efficient user revocation. Based on the principle of traceable-then-revocable, malicious users can be tracked and then revoked directly from the system without complex operations. Besides, to reduce the computation burden on users, our proposal supports online/offline encryption and verifiable outsourced decryption. Security and efficiency analyses show that our proposal is secure and efficient, with high practicability and reliability for VANET.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3228550,,,IEEE

Due to its excellent openness, traceability and other performance, it has immensely promoted the development of this field. However, the traditional “edge-fog-cloud” three-tier architecture model for IoT still faces the threats of privacy disclosure, collusion attack and low efficiency. To solve these problems, in this paper, we creatively design a new consortium blockchain-enhanced IoT architecture, which can enable the permissioned users or participants to enjoy high-quality data services with the assistance of consortium blockchain by taking advantage of its high credibility. Based on this architecture, we propose a novel consortium blockchain-based privacy-preserving range query scheme in decentralized IoT system, named CBCPRQ. This scheme combines consortium blockchain and inner product function encryption technology to realize flexible, safe and batch range query of data service in edge computing. Analysis of security shows that our proposed scheme can not only protect the privacy but also perfectly resist the collusion query inference attack and the replay attack. Extensive performance evaluation is implemented by using Hyperledger Fabric platform and demonstrates that our scheme is efficient, scalable and flexible.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3203182,,,IEEE

The current parking lots mainly use instant parking, which has low parking efficiency, during peak hours, which leads to traffic congestion. To guarantee the stable operation of parking lots, we propose a blockchain-enabled parking reservation framework, called BPR. Traditional parking reservation systems may exist the condition of malicious reservations, and resulting in wasted parking spaces. Therefore, we design a reputation mechanism to manage the parking reservation behavior of vehicles and reduce the number of malicious nodes. In addition, to balance the performance of the blockchain at different times (especially during peak hours), we use deep learning (DL) to dynamically adjust the block size to make the blockchain run more efficiently and stably. We deploy the system in Hyperledger Fabric and conduct effectiveness experiments. The comprehensive evaluation results and analysis show that the proposed reputation mechanism can effectively curb malicious nodes from reserving parking spaces and reduce the waste of parking resources. And the block size will be dynamically adjusted to balance the performance of the blockchain at different periods, this method is also applicable to other blockchain performance-sensitive scenes.

Combining technologies such as distributed blockchain-based mechanisms and smart contracts facilitates the construction of a trusted distributed framework that can defend against DDoS attacks in IoT. In this article, we have proposed a multilevel DDoS mitigation approach (ML-DDoS) to protect IoT devices and other computing resources or machines using the blockchain-based framework.

Wei,China,"['Chang Sha University of Science and Technology', 'Southern University of Science and Technology']",2022.0,"The heavy storage problem has become a key obstacle to the application of blockchain to the actual business environments, because each node needs to keep a complete replica of blockchain data. The data volume grows undesirably large in practice. It prevents the widely used devices, e.g., tablets and mobile phones, to join blockchain systems due to their limited storage and computing resource. Previous work addressed the storage issue by allowing participating nodes to only keep a fraction of the entire transaction set, e.g., sharding. However, existing studies focus on transaction placement with the minimum cross-shard communications. These studies neglect the node characteristics (e.g., storage capacity, cost, and response capability), which impacts the storage performance adversely. In this paper, we propose EBSF, a block storage framework that achieves efficient block storage by constructing a block allocation plan based on node characteristics. Blockchain nodes are organized into committees such that nodes in a committee work together to maintain the entire blockchain data. We formulate the block allocation plan problem that assigns each block to at least one node in a committee. The goal is to minimize the total cost while reaching the threshold of the response capability of each block. We prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose heuristic algorithms. We also propose two strategies to handle the dynamic scenario of new blocks. Extensive evaluation shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3188521,,,IEEE

Frequent incidences of fraudulent practices expose lack of transparency in agri-food supply chains, causing concerns related to economic losses, eroding consumer trust and enterprise brand value. Traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies, banking and finance, blockchains are now being applied in the agri-food sector to address supply chain-related challenges. This article examines the question: How blockchain technology facilitates transparency in agri-food supply chains? Primary attributes of blockchain, namely traceability, immutability, auditability, and provenance, promote transparency in supply chains. Using thematic analysis, the following three areas were identified for implementing blockchain in agri-food supply chains: first, agri-food distribution; second, agri-food origin and sourcing; third, agri-food safety and quality. By cross-mapping thematic areas with primary attributes, our analysis resulted in classification of 25 uses cases. Preliminary findings of this study highlight blockchain-enabled transparency via contemporary uses cases in conceptual, proof-of-concept and commercial stages.

They also suffer from lack of transparency and long transaction delays. These issues can be solved by designing a cryptocurrency in an auditable manner using a permissioned blockchain where a group of authorities can govern the network. In this paper, we propose a low-cost, seamless cross-border payment system based on an auditable cryptocurrency that enables unspent transaction output-based transactions in a consortium blockchain network. To manage the blockchain, participating countries execute the energy-efficient proof of authority consensus algorithm with equal rights. Unlike conventional cryptocurrencies, dynamic decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are used as transacting addresses so that self-manageable authentication can be performed on-chain without any interaction with a trusted third party. The identity of transacting parties is known to respective DID issuers only. This approach enables peer-to-peer transactions while protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency without jeopardizing auditability. For user convenience, multi-party computation and multi-signature protocols are also provided. The system was implemented in Python, and the transaction mechanism was tested.

Khan,Saudi Arabia,"['Shanghai Jiao Tong University', 'King Saud University']",2022.0,"Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of vessels have equipped the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which continuously broadcasts its identity and location information for vessel collision avoidance. To utilize these scattered AIS data for further analysis, there are multiple AIS data platforms collecting AIS data from vessels around the world through their satellites and land-based stations. Thus, users can obtain AIS data of vessels from these platforms without dedicated devices. However, existing platforms work in silos, and AIS data is distributed across different platforms, resulting in reduced data availability. In addition, AIS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, which can undermine the authenticity of AIS data. In this paper, we propose AISChain, a secure and fast blockchain-based AIS data platform. AISChain adopts consortium blockchain, which only permits those authorized parties (i.e., AIS data providers) to participate in the consensus protocol, and is compatible with current commodity AIS hardware. Since the whole system is co-maintained by multiple authorized parties, AISChain can integrate AIS data resources in a secure way. For avoiding repeated recording of AIS data on the chain, we design the Dynamic Bloom Filter Tree (DBFT) to realize efficient duplication detection in the transaction verification phase. We also propose the dual signature scheme to clarify the AIS data ownership. Moreover, we leverage the geographical location-based blockchain sharding approach to further improve the scalability of AISChain. We implement a prototype of AISChain, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of AISChain. Evaluation results show that the search time of DBFT is negligible (4.3 ms) with an extreme low error ratio (0.4%). Meanwhile, AISChain can achieve more than 730 tx/s throughput even when nodes scale to 36.

However, existing platforms work in silos, and AIS data is distributed across different platforms, resulting in reduced data availability. In addition, AIS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, which can undermine the authenticity of AIS data. In this paper, we propose AISChain, a secure and fast blockchain-based AIS data platform. AISChain adopts consortium blockchain, which only permits those authorized parties (i.e., AIS data providers) to participate in the consensus protocol, and is compatible with current commodity AIS hardware. Since the whole system is co-maintained by multiple authorized parties, AISChain can integrate AIS data resources in a secure way. For avoiding repeated recording of AIS data on the chain, we design the Dynamic Bloom Filter Tree (DBFT) to realize efficient duplication detection in the transaction verification phase. We also propose the dual signature scheme to clarify the AIS data ownership. Moreover, we leverage the geographical location-based blockchain sharding approach to further improve the scalability of AISChain. We implement a prototype of AISChain, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of AISChain. Evaluation results show that the search time of DBFT is negligible (4.3 ms) with an extreme low error ratio (0.4%). Meanwhile, AISChain can achieve more than 730 tx/s throughput even when nodes scale to 36. To the best of our knowledge, AISChain is the first work to apply the blockchain technology to secure the AIS data platform.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3188691,,,IEEE

318,318,SPChain: A Smart and Private Blockchain-enabled Framework for Combining GDPR-Compliant Digital Assets Management with AI models,W. -S. Lee; J. A; H. -C. Hsu; P. -A. Hsiung,Taiwan,['National Chung Cheng University'],2022.0,"In the traditional approach to a digital asset management system, the data processing mechanism is not transparent or visible to the data owners since the data is managed solely by the service provider. With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the above issues can be resolved by leveraging the tamper-resistance and decentralization characteristics of blockchain. However, post the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) in 2018, the protection of data owners has taken center stage. This has led to several principles of personal data deletion, such as Storage Limit and the Right to Be Forgotten to conflict with the blockchain. It is also observed that, out of the various smart contracts deployed to manage digital assets, often only specific smart contracts are invoked, while the rest of the deployed smart contracts are rarely invoked, leading to smart contract designs exhibiting similar patterns with very little creativity. This current scenario has motivated us to propose SPChain, a smarter and private GDPR-compliant digital asset management framework enabled by blockchain. In this approach, a decentralized InterPlanetary File System has been adopted to solve the problem of SPOF. In addition, the combination of digital assets with artificial intelligence models has been proposed so as to make digital assets accessible to a larger number of applications and to enable better creativity. In this design, artificial intelligence models have been run in independent, virtualized containers and invoked through smart contracts. The proposed SPChain can be applied to the field of digital art management to provide a complete implementation based on the Hyperledger Fabric. Using this proposed framework, model developers, digital art creators, collectors, service providers, as well as third parties can not only benefit from securely managing digital assets and combining them with AI models, but also from simultaneously complying with the rights stipulated in the GDPR. During the course of the experiments conducted, the latency, throughput, and resource consumption of different functions in the smart contracts have been measured. After adjusting the batch timeout of the block and the maximum number of transactions in a block, the throughputs were observed to be about 500 TPS, with 10 to 15 TPS for reading and writing operations, respectively. The latency ranges were found to range from 0 to 7 seconds, with 2.5 to 5 seconds for reading and writing operations, respectively.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3227969,,,IEEE
319,319,A Cross-Layer Defense Method for Blockchain Empowered CBTC Systems Against Data Tampering Attacks,H. Liang; L. Zhu; F. R. Yu; X. Wang,China,"['Beijing Jiaotong University', 'Carleton University']",2022.0,"Due to the high integration of wireless communication and networking technologies, the communication-based train control (CBTC) systems are exposed to additional cyber-attack surfaces, allowing sophisticated attackers to combine cyber attack vectors with physical attack means to achieve malicious goals. Notably, the decentralized authentication features are missing in existing communication protocols which make the CBTC be easily compromised by data tampering attacks, and lead to serious operational accidents. With outstanding advantages in decentralized authentication, blockchain provides new effective solutions for decentralized identity authentication in CBTC. Consequently, it is critical to study the complex physical consequences of cyber breaches from a cross-layer defense perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-layer defense method for cyber security in blockchain empowered CBTC against data tampering attacks. In the physical layer, the joint Kalman filter and  $ \chi^{2} $  detector is proposed for the train state estimation and detection. In the cyber layer, an asymmetric encryption-based secure communication protocol with identity authentication and the blockchain-based distributed key management system with the adaptive consensus mechanism are designed for data communication security. Considering the unavailable direct observation of the CBTC cyber security states, a partially observable Markov (POMDP) decision model is constructed to derive the optimal adaptive consensus strategies for balancing cyber security and efficiency.

Unfortunately, current personal data privacy protection schemes still suffer from explicit storage, lack of data ownership and implementation of fine-grained access control by users, and lack of transparency and auditability of data. In this article, we propose a personal data privacy protection scheme based on consortium blockchain that stores original data encrypted with an improved Paillier homomorphic encryption mechanism, namely PDPChain, where users realize fine-grained access control based on ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) on blockchain. In this scheme, consortium blockchain combines distributed private clusters to store the encrypted data, improving data transmission efficiency, and guaranteeing user privacy and security through off-chain storage and on-chain transmission synergy. In addition, it is more lightweight encryption and demarcation, ultimately protecting personal data privacy and providing a secure and trusted way to obtain information for data mining. For the performance testing, data in the form of files are used as an example, and the scheme is designed and simulated on Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System. Experimental results show that the improved Paillier encryption mechanism reduces the overall encryption and decryption elapsed time by 25% and encryption elapsed time by 48%.

For improved collaboration, devices from different management domains (e.g., factories) connected through various communication technologies exchange information and share resources. However, they face security and privacy issues when cross-domain communication requires authentication. The limitations of existing schemes include the risk of a single point of failure in a trusted center, leakage of device privacy, high certificate management costs, and low authentication efficiency. Because blockchain with features such as decentralization and tamper-proof can effectively solve some of these problems, we design an efficient and anonymous cross-domain authentication scheme based on blockchain to achieve reliable communication between cross-domain IIoT devices.

However, as more components are connected to the Internet, cyber-criminals can perform malicious actions remotely. As one lasting threat, sabotaging smart devices' execution integrity can cause a large financial loss, i.e., causing malfunctioning. Hence, it is important to secure the execution integrity of smart devices in Industry 4.0. Motivated by the emerging blockchain technology, in this paper, we focus on how blockchain can help Industry 4.0 application protect execution integrity and propose a blockchain-based execution protection scheme named NoSneaky, which is low-cost and can be easily integrated into the current production systems.

Zhu,China,['Henan University'],2022.0,"As an emerging digital concept offering interconnections across multiple platforms, the metaverse provides digital transformations for various aspects of the physical world, facilitated by a few novel technologies, for example, cloud computing offers data support for the digital world. Humans immersed in the metaverse are digital entities who communicate with others or objects, such that ubiquitous access controls (UACs) are indispensable sectors for multiple platforms. However, in the metaverse, UACs have opened a wide scope of bridges for individuals to shuttle the virtual world, which implies that numerous threats exist at the access layer due to a great pool of entries. In this paper, to solve security issues in the UAC setting of the metaverse, we propose a novel blockchain-based multisignature lock for UAC (BMSL-UAC) scheme. All data institutions reconstruct a consortium blockchain system. In addition, our proposed scheme ensures that only authorized users can access an institution’s data. Finally, we abstract the user’s data access behaviors into the transaction information of the consortium blockchain system to realize full life-cycle data management and traceability.

To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a generic anonymous, confidential, and auditable transaction system (named ACA), which is compatible with both UTXO-based permissionless and permissioned blockchains. Core technologies of ACA include designed traceable anonymous key generation and publicly verifiable authorization mechanisms from existing cryptographic tools (i.e. public key encryption, partially homomorphic encryption, and accumulator) as well as the meticulous designed signatures of knowledge and smart contract.

Besides these novel system-level designs, it also introduces a fair and robust trading strategy running by smart contracts on the platform.

To provide DC microgrids with maximum resistance to communication constraints and cyber attacks, a distributed predictive secure control method based on blockchain protocol is proposed in this paper. The proposed control approach is the first attempt to address cyber attacks with a hybrid of data and models, improving the resilience and robustness of DC microgrids. With the help of practical Byzantine ideas, the proposed strategy preserves the resilience strengths of the blockchain against corruption and discards its shortcomings of low real-time performance, significantly enhancing the security without compromising the dynamic performance of the system by active intervention. Subsequently, a bound on the communication delay induced by the blockchain network under the expected security index is given based on the theoretical analysis. Unlike the existing practice of passively tolerating communication delays and packet dropouts, the predictive control method proposed in this paper actively compensates for them experienced by DC microgrids. Then, an analytical model of the closed-loop DC microgrid system is developed, and stability analysis is presented accordingly. Finally, several experimental tests performed on a PV-based DC microgrid hardware system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",1949-3061,,10.1109/TSG.2022.3217807,,,IEEE

Farahmandi,USA,['University of Florida'],2022.0,"The globalized field programmable gate array (FPGA) supply chain’s integrity is frequently challenged by untrusted entities across the world. Counterfeiters continuously attempt to inject illegitimate hardware FPGA integrated circuits (ICs) into the supply chain to maximize their profits. Besides, the software FPGA configuration, bitstream, is susceptible to being manipulated by malicious adversaries. The consequent threats would pose security and safety threats to critical infrastructure considering the rapid growth of the underlying FPGA deployment, calling for a trustworthy supply chain. Therefore, we propose FPGA-Chain, a novel and comprehensive framework to offer device authenticity and bitstream integrity verification for trustworthy traceability throughout the supply chain. Our proposed framework leverages a consortium-style blockchain infrastructure. The specific operations are supported by a set of smart contracts to be able to enroll FPGA hardware and track systems. Our blockchain-based framework can address most of the common attack scenarios and it is capable of identifying the illegitimate FPGA chips and/or bitstreams by checking the in-field statistics against the reference dataset in the blockchain. Our security evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of FPGA-Chain in addressing the targeted counterfeit devices and bitstream tampering threats.",2168-2364,,10.1109/MDAT.2022.3213998,,,IEEE

Thus, verifying whether these body sensors utilized are authentic and reliable in an unimpeachable, credible, and auditable manner without any centralized management is of crucial importance. Furthermore, manipulating data and hijacking in an IoMT context are also of tremendous criticality. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, in this article, a smart contract-based scalable authentication scheme dedicated for IoMT devices is proposed.

Li,China,"['Guangxi University', 'Nanning University']",2022.0,"As an irreversible trend, connected vehicles have become increasingly more popular. They depend on the generation and sharing of data between vehicles to improve safety and efficiency of the transportation system. Due to the open feature of the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), it is possible for dishonest and misbehaving vehicles to disrupt traffic by transmitting false information. In recent years, misbehavior detection systems have been developed to detect the malicious behaviour, and machine learning methods have been employed to make the detection more accurately. However, existing misbehavior detection systems typically require a single entity (e.g., a central server) for centralized data collection and training. Model updates are restricted due to data privacy and high overhead of data communication, which reduces the defensive capability of misbehavior detection systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning scheme to detect misbehavior, which is trained collaboratively by coordinating multiple distributed edge devices while ensuring data security and privacy. In addition, to further protect the privacy of the model on the blockchain, differential privacy with the Gaussian mechanism is leveraged to provide strict privacy protection.

Jamjoom,Saudi Arabia,['King Abdulaziz University'],2022.0,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is vulnerable to leakage of private information during data sharing. To avoid this problem, access control and secure data sharing have been introduced in IoT; however, many challenges are faced because of centralized access control and single delegator selection. Additionally, blockchain is integrated into IoT to enhance the security of the environment. For that purpose, this research proposes Dynamic Secure Access Control using Blockchain (DSA-Block) model, which performs secure access control and data sharing. Initially, the IoT device attributes and user attributes are registered at a local domain authority (LDA) for generating private and public keys using the Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) algorithm, which ensures the legitimacy of the users and devices. Then, the IoT devices send a request message to the edge nodes via a gateway, which performs request filtration by validating the user’s authenticity. The filtered requests are sent to the edge server to perform access delegation using Rock Hyraxes Swarm Optimization (RHSO), which selects a set of delegator nodes. The access control decision is made by using the Trusted Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The IoT data are stored in the cloud server for secure storage, in which the data are secured using a differential privacy mechanism. Finally, dual revocations, such as user attribute revocation and user revocation, are used to maintain security. The performance of DSA-Block is evaluated and the results demonstrate that the proposed DSA-Block model achieves superior performance compared to previous works.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3217087,,,IEEE

426,426,Cerberus: A Blockchain-Based Accreditation and Degree Verification System,A. Tariq; H. B. Haq; S. T. Ali,Pakistan,['National University of Sciences and Technology NUST'],2022.0,"Credential fraud is a widespread practice that undermines investment and confidence in higher education systems and bears significant economic and social costs. Legacy credential verification systems are typically time-consuming, costly, and bureaucratic, and struggle against certain classes of credential fraud. In this article, we propose a comprehensive blockchain-based credential verification solution, Cerberus, which is considerably more efficient, easy, and intuitive to use, and effectively mitigates widespread manifestations of credential fraud. Cerberus also improves significantly upon other blockchain-based solutions in the research literature: it adheres closely to the existing credential verification ecosystem and addresses real-world fraud scenarios. Moreover, Cerberus uses on-chain smart contracts for credential revocation, and it does not entail students or employers to manage digital identities or cryptographic credentials to use the system. We prototype our solution and describe our attempt to design an online verification service with a rich feature set, including data privacy, transcript verification, and selective disclosure of data. We hope this effort contributes positively to alleviating the problem of fake credentials.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3188453,,,IEEE

Due to the magnitude and intricacy of the data, it is difficult to find valuable information that can be used for decision-making and prediction. Big data systems take on a significant infrastructure service to better serve the purpose of IoT systems and support critical decision making. On the other hand, privacy preservation, data integrity, and identity verification are essential requirements in healthcare big data service management. To overcome these problems, this article offers a scalable computing system that provides verifiable data access mechanism for IoT-enabled health data analytics in the big data ecosystem. There are two primary sub-architectures in the proposed architecture, namely a big data analytics tracking system and a derived blockchain-based data storage/access system. This approach leverages big data systems and blockchain architecture to analyze, and securely store data from IoT-enabled devices and allow verified access to the stored data. The zero-knowledge protocol is used to ensure that no information is accessible to unauthenticated users alongside avoiding data linkability.

However, such a technique also brings several potential risks and a huge communication burden. An improper design may give rise to an inconsistent state among different committees. Further, the communication burden arising from cross-shard transactions, unfortunately, reduces the system's performance. In this paper, we first summarize five essential issues that all sharding blockchain designers face. For each issue, we discuss its key challenge and propose our suggested solutions. In order to break the performance bottlenecks, we design a committee structure and propose a reputation mechanism for selecting leaders. The term reputation in our design reflects each node's honest computation resources. In addition, we present a recovery procedure in case the leader is malicious. Theoretically, we prove that the system is robust under our design. Further simulation results also support this. In addition, the results show that selecting leaders by reputation can dramatically improve the system's performance.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2022.3217856,,,IEEE

Nevertheless, there has not been a consensus on how to generate, distribute, and validate trustworthy announcements in such an untrusted wireless environment. Security and privacy, inspiration mechanism, and resource integration are significant challenges for announcement generation and dissemination. In this paper, a secure and trustworthy announcement dissemination scheme is realized for location-based service (LBS) application in VANET. A blockchain-assisted vehicular cloud (VC) architecture is proposed to harvest underutilized heterogeneous resources of vehicles participating in VANET. Moreover, the technologies of blockchain and smart contract are adopted to classify vehicles into different levels automatically by bidding for bonuses. What’s more, vehicles can generate trustworthy announcements with the help of neighbor vehicles by adopting the technology of threshold signature. Meanwhile, the reputation of announcements is evaluated for trust management. Formal security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies fundamental security and privacy requirements in VANET.

440,440,A Privacy-Preserving Transparent Central Bank Digital Currency System Based on Consortium Blockchain and Unspent Transaction Outputs,M. M. Islam; H. P. IN,South Korea,['Korea University'],2022.0,"There is rising global demand for the deployment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) system to achieve financial stability. However, striking a balance between privacy, transparency, and auditability in such a system is technically difficult. We propose a CBDC system based on a consortium blockchain that adopts a privacy-preserving, transparent unspent transaction output (UTXO) model. The proposed system satisfies the travel rule of payment, unlike existing cryptocurrencies. Unlike the conventional UTXO approach, users use wallet-linked addresses for transactions rather than their actual wallet addresses. Each transacting address is generated using two keys: a random private key computed by the sender and the recipient's public key. The final private key is known only to the recipient, and it is required to spend the UTXO received using the address. Thus, each user holds only a single authorized public key and address, which eases regulatory compliance in the network without compromising anonymity and privacy. To manage the blockchain, the central bank and several certificate authorities execute the energy-efficient Clique consensus algorithm. Only the central bank supplies money to the network. A prototype of the system was implemented using Python-Flask, and it outperformed the state-of-the-art systems by providing a smaller transaction size (665 B) and lower verification time (9 ms).",1939-1374,,10.1109/TSC.2022.3226120,,,IEEE

Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is resilient to several task offloading security attacks and it can save about 22.2% and 19.4% of system consumption with respect to the local and edge execution scenarios. Moreover, the benchmark analysis proves that the framework consumes few resources in terms of memory and disk usage, CPU utilization, and transaction throughput.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3190493,,,IEEE

Most existing SE schemes usually delegate search operations to an intermediary such as a cloud server, which would inevitably result in single-point failure, privacy leakage, and even untrustworthy results. Several blockchain-based SE schemes have been proposed to alleviate these issues; however, they suffer from some issues, such as the support for multi-keyword multi-owner model, query privacy and data storage availability. In this paper, we propose BPMS, blockchain-based privacy-preserving multi-keyword search in multi-owner setting, which supports searching over encrypted data in trustworthy, private and efficient manners. The attribute Bloom filter has been introduced into our BPMS to build indexes, which protects query privacy and improves index generation performance. To guarantee data storage availability, our BPMS leverages the advantages of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store large scale of encrypted data. Security proof and comparative analysis in theory indicate that our BPMS is more secure and efficient.

Typically, industrial processes involve heterogeneous activities which require real-time consensus, managed execution, isolation, data sharing, accelerated computation, and efficient utilization of various computational resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. Achieving these in real-time using a single conventional blockchain (BC) leads to the exertion of computational power. To achieve resource-efficient real-time consensus, we virtualize the nodes of the BC network and create different BC for various activities.

For instance, physical attacks on drones provide the attacker with credentials that can be used to inject bogus information into the IoV network, thus jeopardizing not only security but also users’ safety.

Such communities are based on a token reward system and attempt to engross users in the knowledge activities of the community through knowledge payment. Studies have found that the reward system of such communities has been abused (e.g., collusion for profit), but few studies have performed an in-depth analysis for this phenomenon. Consequently, real data for Steemit are used as a case study herein to examine the collusion of users in BOSMs. Two user collusion behaviors (group-voting and vote-buying) are defined and measured. On this basis, an identification and evolutionary survival analysis of the two collusion behaviors are conducted for colluding users and colluding groups, and the behavior patterns of user collusion under the token system are deconstructed. The results of this study improve stakeholders’ understanding of user participation behavior in new online communities, and serve as a reference for decision-making in community governance and token design.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3215185,,,IEEE

Yu,China,['Qingdao University of Science and Technology'],2022.0,"In order to improve traffic conditions and environmental pollution caused by automobile exhaust, it is critical and challenging to help numerous vehicle users to obtain ideal parking spaces in terms of quality of experience (QoE), security and efficiency. The parking assistance scheme using the consortium blockchain can get a tradeoff between security and efficiency, but it is a key issue to meet the preferences of parking space seekers and design a well-operated incentive sharing mechanism. This paper proposes a Parking Assistance Alliance (PAA) scheme based on double auction for vehicular blockchain. Through truthful incentives, the PAA encourages vehicles in the alliance to provide parking information for nearby vehicle users. Further, the vehicle user’s preference is fully considered when assigning the parking space. The matching priority is introduced by incorporating the parking space supply and demand, as a reference to provide prioritized service. Theoretical proofs and simulation results show that the PAA scheme can achieve individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness, with high user satisfaction, and the PAA scheme deployed on the IBM Hyperledger Fabric platform outperforms the existing method with an average of 7.42% higher successful allocation ratio and 35.4% less transaction confirmation time.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3197433,,,IEEE

Hence, the network dynamics of an operational IOTA system would justify a thorough study, which is currently unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we present the first theoretical modeling for the evolving IOTA tangle based on stochastic analysis. After analyzing snapshots of the real-world IOTA ledger data, our key finding suggests that IOTA tangle follows a rather atypical double Pareto Lognormal (dPLN) degree distribution. In contrast, typical power-law and exponential distributions do not accurately reflect the fact. For model parameter estimation, we further realize that using generic optimization solvers cannot yield quality fitting results.

Combining blockchain technology and non-cooperative game model, the established MMS electricity transaction architecture provides a complete information game environment for all game microgrids and facilitates the transparent, efficient, orderly, spontaneous management of MMS electricity transaction without intervention of a third trusted party. Based on the distributed transaction architecture, an MMS robust-game model is presented to achieve the optimal day-ahead bidding-dispatching (DA-BD) strategies, in which the individual microgrid two-stage adjustable robust-game bidding-dispatching (ARG-BD) model characterizes the WPG uncertainty by employing the uncertain interval and adjustable robust parameter. Binary expansion method, duality theory, big M method, and column-and-constrain generation algorithm (C&CG) are employed to solve the individual microgrid two-stage ARG-BD model. The alternating robust-game procedure integrating C&CG algorithm and non-cooperative game model is developed to solve the MMS robust-game model.

Due to its immense economic value, Bitcoin has been subject to numerous malicious theft activities through the exchange platforms. This poses a severe threat to the credibility of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Therefore, it is necessary to provide detection and prediction services of malicious events for Bitcoin Exchanges to prevent them in a precise and timely manner. Meanwhile, preserving the privacy of transaction data to prevent de-anonymization attacks during the detection process is also of great importance. In this paper, we present a general framework for privacy-preserving anomaly detection in blockchain networks. Based on this framework, we propose ADaaS, an anomaly detection service scheme that adopts a supervised machine learning model and achieves privacy preservation by using vector homomorphic encryption and matrix perturbation strategies. We also analyze the security, communication and computation costs of ADaaS. Experimental results demonstrate that ADaaS can achieve high detection effectiveness while providing privacy guarantees and is applicable in real scenarios of detecting Bitcoin transactions due to its reasonable efficiency.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3215006,,,IEEE

491,491,"Tree Representation, Growth Rate of Blockchain and Reward Allocation in Ethereum with Multiple Mining Pools",Q. -L. Li; Y. -X. Chang; C. Zhang,China,['Beijing University of Technology'],2022.0,"It is interesting but difficult and challenging to study Ethereum with multiple mining pools. One of the main difficulties comes from not only how to represent such a general tree with multiple block branches (or sub-chains) related to the multiple mining pools, but also how to analyze a multi-dimensional stochastic system due to the mining competition among the multiple mining pools. In this paper, we first set up a mathematical representation for the tree with multiple block branches. Then we provide a block classification of Ethereum: Regular blocks (in the main chain), orphan blocks, uncle blocks, stale blocks, and nephew blocks, and give some key ratios and probabilities of generating the different types of blocks by applying the law of large numbers. Based on this, we further discuss the growth rate of blockchain and the reward allocation among the multiple mining pools through applying the renewal reward theorem. Finally, we use some simulation experiments to verify our theoretical results, and show that the approximate computation approaches developed, such as the key ratios and probabilities, the long-term growth rate of blockchain, and the long-term reward allocation (rate) among the multiple mining pools, can have a faster convergence. Therefore, we provide a powerful tool for observing and understanding the influence of the selfish mining attacks on the performance of Ethereum with multiple mining pools.

495,495,Attribute-based Encryption with Blockchain Protection Scheme for Electronic Health Records,Y. Jiang; X. Xu; F. Xiao,China,['Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications'],2022.0,"In medical scenarios supported by edge clouds, it is difficult for patients to truly gain ownership of their electronic health records (EHRs). However, it is easy for doctors to modify hospital data to deny incorrect treatment records, which makes it difficult to protect the rights of patients. To improve patient control over EHRs, an attribute-based encryption protection scheme named CEC-ABE for EHRs combined with a blockchain is proposed to protect EHRs in edge cloud environments. In this scheme, the agreement process between the patient and the hospital is completed before the ABE stage, and the treatment information, including the treatment time, treatment doctor and additional information, is confidentially transmitted through an encryption algorithm. By storing the uploaded encrypted data in the blockchain in the form of transaction records, the integrity of the data is guaranteed, which facilitates the traceability of EHR generation. Access to EHRs is controlled by the ABE scheme of the outsourced ciphertext policy, and fine-grained attribute revocation can be employed to ensure the security of the ciphertext. The CEC-ABE algorithm, CP-ABE algorithm and other algorithms are experimentally tested, and the computational cost of each stage of the algorithms and the computational delay of each role are compared. CEC-ABE can significantly improve performance in key generation, outsourced decryption and other stages. Compared with the algorithm whose performance is second only to CEC-ABE, it reduces the computational overhead by 1.73% and 5.2%. The results show that the overall comprehensive performance of the CEC-ABE algorithm is better than that of the other algorithms.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3193707,,,IEEE

Based on the feature extraction ability of LSTM networks, the generated data with CGAN are used as augmented data and applied in the detection and classification of intrusion data. Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of CGAN models using multiple distributed datasets. Blockchain stores and shares the training models to ensure security when the global model’s aggregation and updating.

Wang,Canada,"['Concordia University', 'University of Calgary']",2022.0,"Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on Contact Tracing (CT) models has significantly increased to prevent spread of this highly contagious virus and be prepared for the potential future ones. Since the spreading probability of the novel coronavirus in indoor environments is much higher than that of the outdoors, there is an urgent and unmet quest to develop/design efficient, autonomous, trustworthy, and secure indoor CT solutions. Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. The paper addresses this gap and proposes the Trustworthy Blockchain-enabled system for Indoor Contact Tracing (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed to protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized access. More specifically, it is a fully distributed and innovative blockchain platform exploiting the proposed dynamic Proof of Work (dPoW) credit-based consensus algorithm coupled with Randomized Hash Window (W-Hash) and dynamic Proof of Credit (dPoC) mechanisms to differentiate between honest and dishonest nodes. The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but also quantifies the node’s behavior based on its underlying credit-based mechanism. For achieving high localization performance, we capitalize on availability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures, and develop a data driven localization model based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor measurements. The simulation results show that the proposed TB-ICT prevents the COVID-19 from spreading by implementation of a highly accurate contact tracing model while improving the users’ privacy and security.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3223329,,,IEEE

509,509,zk-AuthFeed: Protecting Data Feed to Smart Contracts with Authenticated Zero Knowledge Proof,Z. Wan; Y. Zhou; K. Ren,China,"['Shandong University', 'Zhejiang University']",2022.0,"The blockchain technology is expected to transform traditional applications with decentralization. When the blockchain technology is applied to decentralize traditional applications (DApps), blockchain validators may need to take in sensitive off-chain data to execute a smart contract. On the one hand, DApps require the off-chain input data to be authentic for correction execution of business procedures. On the other hand, users are afraid of exposing their sensitive privacy on the blockchain. Therefore, it is critical to guarantee authenticity and privacy of the data sent to the smart contract. However, no satisfactory solution has been proposed to attain privacy and authenticity simultaneously. In this work, we first present an authenticated zero knowledge proof scheme called zk-DASNARK by extending the classical zk-SNARK scheme. Based on zk-DASNARK, we design zk-AuthFeed, a zero-knowledge authenticated off-chain data feed scheme to achieve both data privacy and authenticity for blockchain-based DApps. We fully implement zk-AuthFeed, and conduct comprehensive experiments on a medical insurance DApp. We consider 4 typical computation models for insurance premium/reimbursement in the experiments. It shows that zk-AuthFeed is highly efficient: key generation takes about 10 seconds only, proof generation takes less than 4 seconds, and proof verification takes less than 40 ms.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3153084,1.0,,IEEE

BCT provides a trusted decentralized infrastructure to secure data and process executions using distributed ledgers and smart contract to manage complex business processes. Numerous efforts have been made to exploit BCT in supporting dynamic and trusted collaborations of business processes. This paper aims to understand recent BCT development for its BPM applications and identify the limitations and challenges for further development via a systematic literature review (SLR). It is found that numerous works have reported using BCT as technical solutions to fulfill some traditional BPM functions. This paper is distinguished from existing works, especially several relevant surveys in the sense that (1) the impact of using BCT in BPM is thoroughly explored to identify new constraints and challenges explicitly brought by blockchains; (2) the requirements for Business Process Compliance (BPC) are firstly analyzed in detail. Note that BPC is to assure the adherence of business processes to pre-defined policies, standards, specifications, regulations, and laws when business processes are executed. To fill the gaps of BCT applications in these two aspects, Blockchain-as-a-Service (BCaaS) is adopted in business process architecture, and the trends of BCT developments are identified accordingly.",1939-1374,,10.1109/TSC.2022.3199232,,,IEEE

Bharti,Ireland,[],2022.0,"Traditional Federated Learning (FL) adopts a client-server architecture where FL clients (e.g. IoT edge devices) train a common global model with the help of a centralised orchestrator (cloud server). However, current approaches are moving away from centralised orchestration towards a decentralised one in order to fully adapt FL for a cross-silo configuration with multiple organisations acting as clients. State-of-the-art decentralised FL mechanisms make at least one of the following assumptions: (a) clients are trusted organisations and cannot inject low quality model updates for aggregation and (b) client local models can be shared with other clients or a third party for verification of low quality updates. This paper proposes a Blockchain based decentralised framework for scenarios where participatory organisations are believed to be fully capable of injecting low quality model updates as they are not willing to expose their local models to any other entity for verification purpose. The proposed decentralised FL framework adopts a novel hierarchical network of aggregators with the ability to punish/reward organisations in proportion to their local model quality updates. The framework is flexible and unlike state-of-the-art solutions, prevents a single entity from possessing the aggregated model in any FL round of training. The proposed framework is tested with respect to off-chain and on-chain performance in two Industry 4.0 use-cases: predictive maintenance and product visual inspection. A comparative evaluation against the state-of-the-art reveals the proposed framework’s utility in terms of minimizing model convergence time and latency while maximizing accuracy and throughput.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3218704,,,IEEE

With more adaptation, embracement, and development, we are witnessing a steady convergence and fusion of these technologies resulting in an unprecedented paradigm shift that is expected to disrupt and reshape the next generation systems in vertical domains in a way that the capabilities of the technologies are aligned in the best possible way to complement each other. Despite the fact that the convergence of the four technologies can potentially tackle the main shortcomings of existing systems, its adoption is still in its infancy phase, suffering from several issues, such as the absence of consensus towards any reference models or best practices. This paper provides a comprehensive insight into the fusions of these paradigms by discussing a blend of topics addressing all the importation aspects from design to deployment. We will begin this paper by providing an in-depth discussion on the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, applications, and challenges. Following this, we will present a reference architecture and a case study on privacy-preserving stress monitoring and management to better elaborate on the corresponding details and considerations.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3191881,,,IEEE

Zheng,Hong Kong,"['Sun Yatsen University', 'Hong Kong Baptist University']",2022.0,"Payment channel networks (PCNs) are considered as a prominent solution for scaling blockchain, where users can establish payment channels and complete transactions in an off-chain manner. However, it is non-trivial to schedule transactions in PCNs and most existing routing algorithms suffer from the following challenges: 1) one-shot optimization, 2) privacy-invasive channel probing, 3) vulnerability to DoS attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-aware transaction scheduling algorithm with defence against DoS attacks based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), namely PTRD. Specifically, considering both the privacy preservation and long-term throughput into the optimization criteria, we formulate the transaction-scheduling problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process. We then design PTRD, which extends off-the-shelf DRL algorithms to constrained optimization with an additional cost critic-network and an adaptive Lagrangian multiplier. Moreover, considering the distribution nature of PCNs, in which each user schedules transactions independently, we develop a distributed training framework to collect the knowledge learned by each agent so as to enhance learning effectiveness. With the customized network design and the distributed training framework, PTRD achieves a good balance between the optimization of the throughput and the minimization of privacy risks.

535,535,Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Traffic Management Solution Using Crowd-sensing and Blockchain,R. Alkadi; A. Shoufan,UAE,['Khalifa University'],2022.0,"Unmanned aerial vehicles are gaining immense attention in diverse commercial and civil applications. However, adopting this technology will rely on management services that support safe operation. UAV traffic management systems (UTM) aim to facilitate safe, efficient, and fair access to the low-altitude airspace. However, these systems are centralized and lack protocols for secure interaction between the system agents such as authorities, service providers, and end-users. Another limitation of proposed UTM architectures is the absence of efficient mechanisms to enforce airspace rules and regulations. To address these issues, we present a decentralized UTM protocol that controls access to airspace and ensures the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For this purpose, we exploit features of the blockchain and smart-contract technologies. In addition, we employ a mobile crowdsensing technique to seamlessly enforce airspace rules and regulations that govern UAV operations. The solution is implemented on top of the Ethereum platform and evaluated using four different tools for smart-contract verification. We also provide security and performance analysis of the solution. For reproducibility, we made our implementation publicly available on Githubhttps://gist.github.com/rubaalkadi/820d8aeb015aa4f67f0c496bf051be8d.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3201817,,,IEEE

Luo,China,['National University of Defense Technology'],2022.0,"With the rapid development of cloud computing and the sharing economy, crowdsourcing aroused widespread interest and adoption in providing intelligent and efficient services for humans. The majority of existing works focus on effective crowdsourcing task assignment and privacy protection, mostly relying on central servers and assuming that participants are <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$honest$</tex-math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$and$</tex-math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$curious$</tex-math></inline-formula> and proactive. However, in reality, workers may be unwilling to participate, and there may be malicious behavior among participants, thus harming the enthusiasm and interests of other participants. The central server has weaknesses such as single point of failure. To address above problems, we propose a blockchain-based framework for crowdsourcing with reputation and incentive. We first design a worker selection scheme to select credible and capable workers. We leverage reputation as a metric of workers' credibility, which is calculated through the improved subjective logic model. Then we utilize contract theory to design incentive mechanisms to attract more workers, especially high-quality workers to participate. Experimental results show that our proposed method can detect and prevent malicious participants and resist malicious collusion when the proportion of malicious participants is no more than 1/3. And encourage more workers to actively, honestly and continuously participate in crowdsourcing.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2022.3190275,,,IEEE

575,575,Blockchain Function Virtualization: A New Approach for Mobile Networks Beyond 5G,S. K. Taskou; M. Rasti; P. H. J. Nardelli,,[],2022.0,"Many of the key enabling technologies of the fifthgeneration (5G), such as network slicing, spectrum sharing, and federated learning, rely on a centralized authority. This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single point of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is currently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason, mobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users must perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks require energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT users' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low processing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on commodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing. To do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be treated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity servers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain function virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be performed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe applications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by the BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages of BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show the performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption, transaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.",1558-156X,,10.1109/MNET.009.2100473,1.0,,IEEE
576,576,Deep Learning Driven Secure Offline Blockchain in Cyber-Physical Social System,R. Xing; Z. Su; T. H. Luan; R. Li,,[],2022.0,"Cyber-Physical Social System (CPSS) that integrates the social world with the cyber world and physical world plays a crucial role in a more intelligent and efficient network. Recent advances in blockchain have significant impacts on securing the transactions in CPSS. Nevertheless, the deployment of blockchain faces fundamental engineering challenges. Specifically, in the remote or disaster areas, users of CPSS typically cannot effectively connect to the blockchain system in real-time due to the deficiency of Internet connection. In the busy urban areas, users are however reluctant to frequently connect to the blockchain system due to the costly communication connection. Thus, the offline blockchain system, which enables direct secured offline transaction channels among users in CPSS and efficiently synchronizes batch transactions to the global blockchain system, is a promising solution to address the problems. This article presents a novel CPSS architecture that can realize the secure transactions for users participating in the offline blockchain transactions by making use of AI based algorithm. We first introduce three typical offline blockchain transaction environments in CPSS, followed by the analysis of the security issues of the proposed architecture. In addition, we present the Hashed Time Locked Contract (HTLC) established for the CPSS users participating in the offline blockchain transaction. To detect the potential malicious attackers in the offline transactions, we introduce an LSTM based RNN model to detect the malicious transaction witness. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of such model.",1558-156X,,10.1109/MNET.111.2100700,,,IEEE

These constraints render existing solutions inefficient on data federation. In this work, we propose a novel local dominance based framework for efficient skyline queries over a vertical data federation. We decompose the skyline query into plaintext local dominance computations and secure result aggregations, which can perform as many computations in plaintext as possible without compromising security. We further propose a dedicate private set intersection based algorithm to accelerate the query processing.

The model contains three first-level indicators and nine second-level indicators, covering various aspects of the performance of mining pool.

To address the latency issues caused by the blockchain operation in MEC, we develop a new Proof-of-Reputation consensus mechanism based on a lightweight block verification strategy. To accommodate the highly dynamic environment and high-dimensional system state space, we apply a novel distributed deep reinforcement learning-based approach by using a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm.

595,595,Efficient and Trusted Data Sharing in a Sharding-enabled Vehicular Blockchain,X. Zhang; W. Xia; Q. Cui; X. Tao; R. P. Liu,,[],2022.0,"Data sharing is essential for future autonomous vehicles in vehicular networks. Building trust in the shared data can be challenging among mutually unknown vehicles in an open and distributed environment. Blockchain is the key to establish trusted data sharing in a decentralized vehicular environment. However, the low efficiency (e.g., transaction per second, TPS) of blockchain is the bottleneck for the efficient data sharing. Moreover, the highly dynamic topology, the imperfect wireless links, and the limited radio coverage may further slow down the blockchain consensus process. To improve the efficiency and trustworthiness of data sharing in a vehicular network, we propose a sharding-enabled vehicular blockchain system. Specifically, the blockchain-enabled vehicles are dynamically allocated to different shards based on their geographical locations so that transactions are processed in parallel. We design an efficient and trusted sharding-enabled blockchain consensus mechanism by integrating a reputation-assisted intrashard consensus and a vehicle-assisted inter-shard consensus. The reputation assistance in intra-shard consensus is designed to defend against the collusive false-block attack that may happen in a small-scale shard environment. The vehicle-assisted intershard consensus is designed to tackle the issues caused by defective roadside units (RSUs). Simulation results demonstrate the improved performance on efficiency and trustworthiness of the proposed system. In addition, trusted data sharing can be established even under the conditions of malicious vehicles or attacked RSUs.",1558-156X,,10.1109/MNET.122.2100755,,,IEEE

601,601,Toward Optimal MEC-Based Collision Avoidance System for Cooperative Inland Vessels: A Federated Deep Learning Approach,W. Hammedi; B. Brik; S. M. Senouci,France,['University Bourgogne Franche Comté'],2022.0,"Cooperative collision avoidance between inland waterway ships is among the envisioned services on the Internet of Ships. Such a service aims to support safe navigation while optimizing ships' trajectories. However, to deploy it, timely and accurate prediction of ships' positioning with real-time reactions is needed to anticipate collisions. In such a context, ships positions are usually predicted using advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Traditionally, ML schemes require that the data be processed in a centralized way, e.g., a cloud data center managed by a third party. However, these schemes are not suitable for the collisions avoidance service due to the inaccessibility of ships' positioning data by this third party, and allowing connected ships to get access to sensitive information. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new cooperative collision avoidance system for inland ships, while ensuring data security and privacy. Our system is based on deep federated learning to collaboratively build a model of ship positioning prediction, while avoiding sharing their private data. In addition, it is deployed at multi-access edge computing (MEC) level to provide low-latency communication to ensure fast responses during collision detection. Furthermore, it relies on Blockchain and smart contracts to ensure trust and valid communications between ships and MEC nodes. We evaluate the proposed system using a generated dataset representing ships mobility in France. The results, which demonstrate the accuracy of our prediction model, prove the effectiveness of our cooperative collision avoidance system in ensuring timely and reliable communications and avoiding collisions between ships.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3154158,1.0,,IEEE

Especially, when a data provider claims rewards with its real identity for its shared data, the linkage between its real identity and the shared data will expose participators private information, such as location. To protect users privacy in the scenario, a privacy and efficiency-oriented data sharing mechanism for IoTs is proposed. We first design a blockchain-based data sharing framework where the behavior of all participants will be supervised. Then, in order to hide the real identities of data providers during data sharing process, a dynamic pseudo-identity policy is proposed.

This paper thus carried out a performance analysis of the blockchain-enabled data-sharing framework from latency and data age perspectives to investigate the suitability of blockchain technology in data sharing systems. To achieve this, the uniqueness of such systems such as transactions validation latency, transaction generation rate, waiting time, blockchain-appending rate, and overall communication latency were jointly studied. The communication latency was characterized following the spatiotemporal modeling approach. We further adopted the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol due to its well discussed suitability in large-scale data sharing applications and captured the validation stages of such a PBFT scheme using the Erlang distribution of order $k$.

Due to the involvement of blockchain which is transparent, account privacy is easily violated in BIAC. Motivated by the recent progress of utilizing Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to protect account privacy in cryptocurrencies, this article systematically investigates a ZKPbased privacy-enhancing BIAC architecture. We summarize the design principles as authenticating transactions with ZKP proofs instead of digital signatures so that permissions are linked to off-chain secrets rather than on-chain accounts. However, since the ZKP proofs are stored on the blockchain, an adversary may launch replay attacks to access resources illegally. To tackle this challenge, we carefully design two account-hiding transactions as well as validation rules for the classical capability-based AC (CBAC) model, where all ZKP proofs expire once used. The enhanced system preserves all necessary functions of CBAC while achieving permission invisibility and requester anonymity.

Second, it enables robust vehicular communication against insiders’ attacks by allowing a vehicle to send unique proof generated from its private information with messages. Receivers can authenticate the messages by comparing attached values to the information through the blockchain in a non-interactive manner. Security analysis shows that our scheme assures secure V2X communication against insider attacks, and efficiency analysis shows how both authentication and consensus delay change.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3224465,,,IEEE
617,617,"A Novel Oracle-aided Industrial IoT Blockchain: Architecture, Challenges, and Potential Solutions",Y. Du; J. Li; L. Shi; Z. Wang; T. Wang; Z. Han,,[],2022.0,"Smart contract over the blockchain accelerates the deployment of decentralized Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. However, the usability of smart contracts is constrained to the data on the blockchain, and has no direct access to the off-chain environment. Consequently, smart contract cannot directly serve as a carrier for the IIoT applications that rely on intensive data exchange and task computation. To cope with this issue, we first propose an oracle-aided IIoT blockchain (OIB) system to facilitate the deployment of smart contract based IIoT applications. Specifically, a distributed oracle network is employed to not only bridge the off-chain environment and smart contracts, but also extend the computing capability of smart contracts. Then, we study important properties of the OIB system, i.e., liveness, safety, and fairness. In particular, we propose a new challenge of fairness to guarantee that each oracle can reap positive utility (i.e., individual rationality), and a new challenge of liveness to meet delay constraints of oracle services (i.e., delay-sensitivity). To address these two challenges, we develop an auction based incentive mechanism for the data-feeding oracles to achieve individual rationality as well as incentive compatibility, and a delay-sensitive matching based incentive mechanism for the computing oracles under specific delay constraints. Simulation results corroborate that the proposed auction based incentive mechanism guarantees not only truthfulness but also individual rationality, and show that the matching based incentive mechanism achieves smaller delay than the random selection scheme used in the Decentralized Oracle Service (DOS) network.",1558-156X,,10.1109/MNET.103.2100395,,,IEEE

619,619,V2GNet: Robust Blockchain-Based Energy Trading Method and Implementation in Vehicle-to-Grid Network,Y. Liang; Z. Wang; A. B. Abdallah,Japan,['The University of Aizu'],2022.0,"Nowadays, energy trading policies are revolutionizing the efforts and policies geared toward addressing global carbon emissions and protecting the environment. Smart grids and electric vehicles (EVs) are energy-saving tools for efficient power management. Although EVs can act as both energy consumers and suppliers, the effort required to balance the energy supply and demand in typical centralized trading systems inevitably reduces trading reliability. Another challenge is distributing EVs’ energy rationally to achieve better demand response and energy utilization. To manage the market securely and efficiently, we propose V2GNeta, a blockchain-based energy trading system using the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network. The system combines a blockchain of energy exchanges (BoE) and a blockchain of EVs (BoEV), with the distinct transmission of energy requests and offers. Furthermore, to consider energy management from an economic viewpoint, we address the attack issue by proposing a robust energy trading (RET) algorithm. The proposed system demonstrates high robustness to malicious attacks. Our experimental results show that the RET reduces 30% energy loss when 20% of consumers are attacked. Moreover, malicious exchanges are excluded progressively from the trading market during each trading round. Also, the RET algorithm achieves better energy fulfillment and higher profit compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3229432,,,IEEE

Cuffe,Ireland,['University College Dublin'],2022.0,"The dynamic nature of competitive electricity markets means that participants often resort to some form of derivative financial instrument. One such instrument is a Contract-for-Difference (CFD), usually available to renewable generators in certain electricity markets to enable them to hedge their price risk. Embracing CFD presents new risks such as counterparty credit, margining, third-party, legal, and process risks. Derivative instruments existing on blockchains have recently demonstrated potential as suitable hedging tools for minimizing the risks of renewable generators. The present manuscript applies this concept for the first time to hedge the price risk of renewable generators by implementing a novel decentralized finance instrument, an Ethereum blockchain marketplace governed by a smart contract to mediate between stakeholders mutually enrolled in bilateral CFD arrangements.

The traditional system of storing and auditing claims is centralized to the corresponding organizations. As the centralized auditing system does not allow the integration of the claims among different insurance organizations, an individual policyholder or a service provider may submit claims to more than one insurance organization to get multiple benefits. Multiple benefits can be avoided by collaborating with the authority of different organizations. However, collaborating different organizations raise the privacy and security concerns. Hence, in this paper, we propose a Quorum based Federated Blockchain Network (QFBC), a privacy-preserving decentralized system to integrate health insurance claims of different organizations in a secure manner. The performance of the proposed QFBN framework in avoiding multiple benefits and providing privacy and security which is analyzed in terms of Security Incidents (SI), Mean Time To Detect (MTTD), and Mean Time For Vendors Incident Response (MTFVIR) are compared with the decentralized frameworks that developed for detecting healthcare frauds using blockchain.

Shen,Canada,"['University of Waterloo', 'Queens University', 'University of Guelph']",2022.0,"Decentralized anonymous payment (DAP) enables users to directly transfer cryptocurrencies privately without passing through a central authority. Anonymous cryptocurrencies have been proposed to improve the privacy degree of DAP systems, such as Zerocash and Monero. However, the strong degree of privacy may cause new regulatory concerns, i.e., the anonymity of transactions can be used for illegal activities, such as money laundering and terrorist financing. In this paper, we propose a novel DAP scheme that supports regulatory compliance and enforcement. We first introduce regulators into the system, who define regulatory policies for anonymous payment, and the policies are enforced through commitments and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for compostable statements. By which, users can prove that transactions are valid and comply with regulations. A tracing mechanism is embedded in the scheme to allow regulators to recover the real identities of users when suspicious transactions are detected. The formal security model and proof are provided to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve desired security properties, and the performance evaluation shows its high efficiency.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3144991,,,IEEE

SAZyzz exhibits a better performance/scalability compared to the state-of-the-art leader-based BFT consensus protocols. It is built on top of AZyzzyva and has adopted a tree-based communication model which enables it to enhance the scalability of AZyzzyva. Additionally, SAZyzz reduces the communication complexity to O(logN) in two paths of the protocol. However, the tree-based topology has been argued that has a shortcoming when used in designing BFT consensus protocols. This refers to the strong assumption that all the internal nodes of the tree are honest, which leads to a trade-off between tolerating Byzantine faults and better performance and scalability. This paper shows that, with the current technological infrastructures available for industrial systems, such as Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), this assumption is realistic. SAZyzz comprises of fast-path and backup-path, each of which has two modes: simple mode and scalable mode.

As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for training a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security challenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from malicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which will degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this paper, we shall propose a decentralized blockchain based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep reinforcement learning based algorithm to provide high system performance with low computational complexity.

However, most sharding systems leverage a non-cooperative design, which lowers the fault tolerance resilience due to the decreased mining power as the consensus execution is limited to each separated shard. To this end, we present Benzene, a novel sharding system that enhances the performance by cooperation-based sharding while defending the per-shard security. Firstly, we establish a double-chain architecture for function decoupling. This architecture separates transaction-recording functions from consensus-execution functions, thereby enabling the cross-shard cooperation during consensus execution while preserving the concurrency nature of sharding. Secondly, we design a cross-shard block verification mechanism leveraging Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), via which miners can verify blocks from other shards during the cooperation process with the minimized overheads. Finally, we design a voting-based consensus protocol for cross-shard cooperation. Transactions in each shard are confirmed by all shards that simultaneously cast votes, consequently achieving an enhanced fault tolerance and lowering the confirmation latency. We implement Benzene and conduct both prototype experiments and large-scale simulations to evaluate the performance of Benzene. Results show that Benzene achieves superior performance than existing sharding/non-sharding blockchain protocols. In particular, Benzene achieves a linearly-improved throughput with the increased number of shards (e.g., 32,370 transactions per second with 50 shards) and maintains a lower confirmation latency than Bitcoin (with more than 50 shards).

To this end, we present Benzene, a novel sharding system that enhances the performance by cooperation-based sharding while defending the per-shard security. Firstly, we establish a double-chain architecture for function decoupling. This architecture separates transaction-recording functions from consensus-execution functions, thereby enabling the cross-shard cooperation during consensus execution while preserving the concurrency nature of sharding. Secondly, we design a cross-shard block verification mechanism leveraging Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), via which miners can verify blocks from other shards during the cooperation process with the minimized overheads. Finally, we design a voting-based consensus protocol for cross-shard cooperation. Transactions in each shard are confirmed by all shards that simultaneously cast votes, consequently achieving an enhanced fault tolerance and lowering the confirmation latency. We implement Benzene and conduct both prototype experiments and large-scale simulations to evaluate the performance of Benzene. Results show that Benzene achieves superior performance than existing sharding/non-sharding blockchain protocols. In particular, Benzene achieves a linearly-improved throughput with the increased number of shards (e.g., 32,370 transactions per second with 50 shards) and maintains a lower confirmation latency than Bitcoin (with more than 50 shards). Meanwhile, Benzene maintains a fixed fault tolerance at 1/3 even with the increased number of shards.",1558-2183,,10.1109/TPDS.2022.3227198,,,IEEE
685,685,Toward Secure Data Sharing for the IoT devices with limited resources: A Smart Contract–Based Quality-Driven Incentive Mechanism,C. Zhang; T. Shen; F. Bai,China,['Kunming University of Science and Technology of China'],2022.0,"With the rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various industries and fields, the massive amount of data produced by these devices can yield greater value through sharing. A critical challenge in the data sharing process is ensuring that the data is high quality. However, the quality of data provided by a large number of IoT devices is impacted by the variability of factors contributing to the data quality (DQ). Effective and safe sharing of perception data by the limited resources of IoT devices is a problem worth investigating. In this article, we propose a smart contract–based and DQ-driven incentive mechanism. First, a smart contract is proposed to realize security in the data-sharing process, while the proposed DQ evaluation mechanism ensures the quality of the shared data. Second, a two-layer Stackelberg game of Nested Coalitional(TLSNC) scheme is designed to obtain the maximum overall social welfare according to the trust score obtained during DQ evaluation while satisfying the limitation of loose and insufficient computing resources. Moreover, we designed a smart contract for automatic execution of the data-sharing transaction and used a trusted execution environment (TEE) to complete the security calculation of shared data. Finally, the numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the DQ evaluation mechanism and the security of our TEE-based model. Based on the proposed scheme, sustainable incentives for user participation and high-quality data sharing can be achieved. In addition, our system can significantly improve the overall social welfare compared to traditional solutions.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3142786,1.0,,IEEE

The large-scale demand for storage space constrains new nodes from joining the network, which seriously hinders the development of blockchain technology. In this paper, to explore the data characteristics of the Bitcoin blockchain, we performed a comprehensive statistical experiment on the current 680,000 blocks. The analysis results indicated that in nearly 95% of blocks, the number of spent transaction output (STXO) accounts for more than 67% of the total transaction outputs. Inspired by this feature, we proposed a novel storage scheme to reduce the size of blocks by deleting the transaction data with the STXO ratio over 67% first and compressing fixed-length fields of those transactions. Then, the newly generated block files were deposited to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) private network to improve the scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain. The experiments and evalutions showed that the proposed scheme achieved a compression ratio of 96.9% and saved 330GB of storage space for the Bitcoin full nodes while guaranteeing the normal operation of the Bitcoin network.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3199346,,,IEEE

We determine the size of the traces for storing on the S&G blocks (blocks that store traces along with their metadata) by considering principal parameters such as training time, block size, and error. In general, S&G consists of three phases: 1) Categorizing the data into groups based on their sampling rates, 2) Storing the trace of data and metadata into the blocks, and 3) Retrieving the entire data.

Lee,Taiwan,"['National Taipei University of Business', 'Feng Chia University']",2022.0,"The utilization of cloud and edge computing has become one of the most prevailing resource supply mechanisms. Thousands of enterprise users and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have performed operations through services sold by computing resource providers. So far, the auction match is the main strategy for allocating resources, in which there exists a trusted third party playing a role as a broker to deal with resource allocation requests for both providers and consumers. The main concerns in resource allocation architecture are how and how long to solve the Winner Determination Problem (WDP), which is used to lay out the match outcome. It is not easy for a single broker with limited computing power to generate an optimal solution in a short period since its corresponding time complexity is regarded as the NP-hard problem. Meanwhile, it is hard for people to trust the third party thoroughly. That is, there are three potential issues, including centralization, data security, and untrustworthiness in traditional matching architecture. In particular, the real-time matching cannot be achieved to fulfill users who have urgent needs of computing resources. To solve above issues, we have designed a trustworthy and real-time decentralized computing resource allocation platform based on blockchain and smart contract. In order to optimize the allocation results, we improve the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for miners to reach the consensus mechanism.

Fortunately, techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) allow the creation of selection models without human interaction by identifying the BC features that match the requirements provided by the user in an automated and flexible manner. Thus, this work presents the design and implementation of an ML-based BC selection approach that employs five ML models to select the most suitable BC given user requirements (e.g. BC popularity, fast block inclusion, or Smart Contract -SC support). The approach follows an ML-specific data flow and defines a novel equation to quantify the popularity of a BC.

The current IoT platforms lack techniques for transparent and tamper-proof ordering of events due to their device-centric logging mechanism. In this paper, we develop a framework that facilitates tamper-proof transparency and event order in an IoT platform by proposing a Blockchain protocol and adopting the vector clock system, both tailored for the resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT devices, respectively. To cope with the unsuited storage (e.g., ledger) and computing power (e.g., proof of work puzzle) requirements of the Blockchain in the commercial off-the-shelf IoT devices, we propose a partial consistent cut protocol and engineer a modular arithmetic-based lightweight proof of work puzzle, respectively.

Our event ordering protocol based on the vector clock system is also novel for the IoT platforms. We implement our framework using an IoT gateway and 30 IoT devices.

McIntosh,Canada,"['McGill University', 'University of Waterloo']",2022.0,"Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchains that run upon meeting predetermined conditions. Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable, thus, defects in the deployed code cannot be fixed. As a consequence, software engineering anti-patterns, such as code cloning, pose a threat to code quality and security if unnoticed before deployment. In this paper, we report on the cloning practices of the Ethereum blockchain platform by analyzing 33,073 smart contracts amounting to over 4MLOC. Prior work reported an unusually high 79.2% of code clones in Ethereum smart contracts. We replicate this study at the conceptual level, i.e., we answer the same research questions by employing different methods. In particular, we analyze clones at the granularity of functions instead of code files, thereby providing a more fine-grained estimate of the clone ratio.

706,706,Code Cloning in Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Platform: An Extended Replication Study,F. Khan; I. David; D. Varro; S. McIntosh,de,"['McGill University', 'University of Waterloo']",2022.0,"Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchains that run upon meeting predetermined conditions. Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable, thus, defects in the deployed code cannot be fixed. As a consequence, software engineering anti-patterns, such as code cloning, pose a threat to code quality and security if unnoticed before deployment. In this paper, we report on the cloning practices of the Ethereum blockchain platform by analyzing 33,073 smart contracts amounting to over 4MLOC. Prior work reported an unusually high 79.2% of code clones in Ethereum smart contracts. We replicate this study at the conceptual level, i.e., we answer the same research questions by employing different methods. In particular, we analyze clones at the granularity of functions instead of code files, thereby providing a more fine-grained estimate of the clone ratio. Furthermore, we analyze more complex clone types, allowing for a richer analysis of cloning cases. To achieve this finer granularity of cloning analysis, we rely on the NiCad clone detection tool and extend it with support for Solidity, the programming language of the Ethereum platform.

707,707,PACM: Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme with On-Chain Certificate Management for VANETs,G. Sang; J. Chen; Y. Liu; H. Wu; Y. Zhou; S. Jiang,China,"['China University of Mining and Technology', 'Xix2019an Jiaotong University', 'East China Normal University']",2022.0,"Privacy-preserving authentication is designed to protect vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) from illegitimate users and fake messages while maintaining the privacy of legitimate users’ identities. However, existing authentication schemes have disadvantages such as non-transparent certificate issuance and revocation, high identity authentication and certificate revocation overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme with on-chain certificate management (PACM) in VANETs, where the service manager (SM) of each domain serves as a node of the blockchain to build a distributed system. Specifically, based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and exclusive-OR operations, we achieve secure and lightweight mutual authentication between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) by regularly updated pseudonyms. Then, we adopt the blockchain to record the issuance and revocation of all certificates, which makes SM’s activities transparent. Moreover, we introduce the counting garbled bloom filter (CGBF) to enable fast query and revocation of certificates. Besides, we design a non-forgeable and non-repudiable billing mechanism based on the hash chain technology. Security analysis and experimental results show that PACM achieves stronger security with less overhead.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3201551,1.0,,IEEE

712,712,Toward Achieving Anonymous NFT Trading,Z. Chen; K. Omote,Japan,['University of Tsukuba'],2022.0,"With the rapid development of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market, various types of digital artwork are published via NFT in recent years for sale. In the current NFT system, owner’s address of each NFT is stored in plaintext. This leads to a severe privacy problem: once a person’s blockchain address is known, all his NFT assets are viewable, which may further cause problems related to the privacy of holding sensitive NFT or premeditated scams to high-value NFT owners. However, due to the limitation of Ethereum and smart contract, it is hard to prevent others from tracking the owner of NFT. Meanwhile, current state-of-the-art NFT research usually assumes the relation between blockchain address and owner’s identity is unknown, thus creating the so-called anonymity. In this paper, based on the most popular NFT marketplace OpenSea’s system, we propose a new exchange scheme to hides the address of NFT owner during trading. To achieve our goal, a proof of commitment scheme is exploited to bind the owner to an NFT while hiding the identity. Moreover, An anonymous payment method is designed to prevent attackers from tracing the Ether flow in NFT trading. Our scheme is proven to be secure against curious users and malicious active attackers. Implementation on testnet also shows that the increased gas cost is acceptable, meaning it is suitable for application.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3228787,,,IEEE

Gao,China,"['Chongqing Technology and Business University', 'Chongqing University', 'Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications']",2022.0,"Multi-view finger-vein recognition technology has attracted increasing attentions in recent years. Despite recent advances in the multi-view finger-vein identification, existing solutions employ multiple monocular cameras from different views to record two-dimensional (2D) projections of 3D vein vessels, which causes the following problems: 1) 2D images collected from limited views (two or three views) are insufficient for robust 3D vein vessel feature representation. Furthermore, image sequences of the same finger acquired from different views usually show significant differences. As a result, the existing works are still sensitive to positional variations of the fingers, specifically those caused by finger roll movements. 2) Using multiple cameras can lead to increased costs. Moreover, it is impossible to employ several cameras to acquire full-view images because of the limited space on capturing devices. To address the above issues, we present FV-LT, a Full-View Finger-Vein identification system based on a Local attention Transformer, by implementing an image acquisition device with a single camera. First, we design and implement a finger-vein acquisition prototype device that utilizes a single camera and a LED group to rotate along a finger for full-view image collection. This allows capturing all vein patterns concealed beneath human skin to form a complete representation of finger features. Second, given the full-view vein images, we propose a local attention transformer-based approach to extract dependency features of a token (a patch or an image) on its neighborhood’s tokens among image patches and among full-view images, respectively. These dependency features are shown to be robust to positional variations induced by finger rolls. Based on the public database of full-view finger-vein images captured by our designed device, we verify the performance of the proposed FV-LT.

Jonathan Wu,Canada,"['Guangzhou University', 'Nanjing University Information Science  Technology', 'University of Windsor', 'University of Western Ontario']",2022.0,"Human action recognition (HAR) is one of most important tasks in video analysis. Since video clips distributed on networks are usually untrimmed, it is required to accurately segment a given untrimmed video into a set of action segments for HAR. As an unsupervised temporal segmentation technology, subspace clustering learns the codes from each video to construct an affinity graph, and then cuts the affinity graph to cluster the video into a set of action segments. However, most of the existing subspace clustering schemes not only ignore the sequential information of frames in code learning, but also the negative effects of noises when cutting the affinity graph, which lead to inferior performance. To address these issues, we propose a sequential order-aware coding-based robust subspace clustering (SOAC-RSC) scheme for HAR.

Yang,China,"['Guangzhou University', 'China University of Science and Technology of China']",2022.0,"Online service providers benefit from collecting and analyzing preference data from users, including both implicit preference data (e.g., watched videos of a user) and explicit preference data (e.g., ranking data over candidates). However, it brings ethical and legal issues of data privacy at the same time. In this paper, we study the problem of aggregating individual's preference data in the local differential privacy (LDP) setting. One naive approach is to add Laplace random noises, which however suffers from low statistical utility and is fragile to LDP-specific poisoning attacks. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism to improve the utility and the robustness simultaneously: the additive mechanism. The additive mechanism randomly outputs a subset of candidates with a probability proportional to their total scores. For preference data with Borda rule over $d$ items, its mean squared error bound is optimized from $O(\frac{d^{5}}{n\epsilon ^{2}})$ to $O(\frac{d^{4}}{n\epsilon ^{2}})$, and its maximum poisoning risk bound is reduced from $+\infty$ to $O(\frac{d^{2}}{n\epsilon })$. We also theoretically investigate minimax lower bounds of $\epsilon$-LDP preference data aggregation, and prove the error rate of $O(\frac{d^{4}}{n\epsilon ^{2}})$ is optimal for the Borda rule. Experimental results validate that our proposed approaches averagely reduce estimation error by 50% and are more robust to adversarial poisoning attacks.",1558-2191,,10.1109/TKDE.2022.3207486,,,IEEE

Although network slicing can realize the flexible division of 5g network resources and quickly customize virtual networks that meet the differentiated needs of customers, it is still difficult to determine the optimal service quality parameters in application scenarios. To solve the problem, this paper designs a multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model to calculate the service quality parameters of the network slicing. The calculated service quality parameters can be used as an adjustment basis in the negotiation of the SLA between the customer and the network operator. However, the traditional method of calculating information across chains will cause frequent information interactions and affect efficiency. Therefore, in this scheme, we deploy a smart contract on each blockchain to calculate the information, which can reduce the frequency of information transmission and improve efficiency. In addition, in order to make the calculation between smart contracts more fluent and the requirements more relevant, this paper proposes to coordinate the development of smart contracts through multiple blockchains. Besides, to ensure the cross-chain security calculation, the signature by Cosi protocol and multi-signcryption algorithms are used in the transmission of non-private information and private information in the cross-chain process respectively. Security analysis and experimental results prove that the multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model is feasible and efficient in practice.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3132388,,,IEEE

Then, we propose a walk strategy that combines timestamps and transaction amounts to represent the information that occurs at the time of a transaction. To mine the types of nodes and edges, we use a heterogeneous network representation learning method to map the transaction network to a low-dimensional space. Finally, we improve the accuracy of the embedding results in the node classification task, which has important implications for Ethereum mining as well as identity recognition.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3164719,,,IEEE

Recently, methods for threat information sharing and defense require cooperation and trust between multiple domains/entities. There is a need for mechanisms that establish distributed trust to allow for such a collective defense. In this paper, we present a novel threat intelligence sharing and defense system, namely “DefenseChain,” to allow organizations to have incentive-based and trustworthy cooperation to mitigate the impact of cyber attacks. Our solution approach features a consortium Blockchain platform and an economic model to obtain threat data and select suitable peers to help with attack detection and mitigation. We apply DefenseChain in the financial technology industry for an insurance claim processing use case to demonstrate the effectiveness of DefenseChain in a real-world application setting. Our evaluation experiments with DefenseChain implementation are performed on an Open Cloud testbed with Hyperledger Composer and in a simulation environment. Our results show that the DefenseChain system overall performs better than state-of-the-art decision making schemes in choosing the most appropriate detector and mitigator peers.

Our scheme keeps one of the matrices in MMC semantically secure and allows a public verification of the server's work. In particular, the client's work is faster than the native MMC for square matrices of order $\geq 7000$, while the best existing scheme requires matrices of order $\geq 270000$.

We first provide an overview of Nxt and its PoS consensus algorithm design, and introduce a concise mathematical analysis of the Nxt PoS algorithm. We then present an experimental study on the Nxt PoS behavior in a simulated environment and in a small network running Nxt private nodes. We show that the fractions of the blocks generated by forgers in the system are generally proportional to their weight in stakes provided that the weight is relatively small, which is consistent with the mathematical analysis. We consider two scenarios of double-spending attacks: (1) a single dominating forger with large stakes; and (2) a group of colluding forgers that collectively control large stakes. The simulation results show that the single-forger attack is more advantageous over using a pool of forgers in launching successful double-spending attacks. Finally, we propose a quota-based mechanism to limit the fraction of blocks that any forger could generate. We show that the mechanism is highly effective in mitigating the single-forger attack, but has limited success in preventing the double-spending attacks based on forging pools.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3193092,,,IEEE

Son,GA,"['Brown University', 'Hanyang University', 'University of Bristol', 'Kennesaw State University']",2022.0,"Group Key Exchange (GKE) is an important tool to develop secure multi-user applications such as group text messages, ad-hoc networks, and so on. Most of the currently deployed GKE schemes are synchronous, i.e., they require all the participants to be online during their execution. However, with more battery-powered devices being used in such applications, the synchronicity requirement is challenging to fulfill. To fill the gaps, asynchronous GKE schemes have been introduced in the literature. Nevertheless, the currently available asynchronous and synchronous GKE schemes rely on Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) for key establishment and management. To this end, reliance on TTPs is a serious shortcoming since TTPs are well known to be the single point of failure. Furthermore, the existing GKE schemes require participants to perform all computations, which can degrade the performance of resource-constrained devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose an asynchronous GKE scheme that uses blockchain and smart contracts to store the security keys-related material and reduce the computational load of the participants. Furthermore, our proposed scheme provides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and Post-Compromised Security (PCS).

However, in a distributed environment, how to guarantee the privacy of users in electricity trading while ensuring the efficiency of the transactions is one of the urgent issues to be solved. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based signature (DABS) scheme for distributed electricity trading, which can support users' free choice of trade objects without revealing their real identities. We construct a signature generation and verification method by taking advantage of the open and hard-to-tamper properties of blockchain to achieve signature verifiability independent of dynamic changes in attributes. To improve the update efficiency, we propose an improved scheme that enables the update complexity to be reduced from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of users. Finally, performance analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate the security and practicality of DABS.",1941-0050,,10.1109/TII.2022.3228688,,,IEEE

Wang,China,['Xidian University'],2022.0,"Ride-sharing services emerging in recent years provide a convenient, green, and indispensable mode of trip. Nevertheless, the lack of confidentiality as well as traceability of the travel data, the reliance of most ride-sharing services on centralized storage structures, and the issue of trust between passengers and drivers are pressing problems to be addressed. To mitigate these problems, a perfect data protection, storage, and reputation management (DPSRM) scheme is proposed for ride-sharing services. First, a passenger utilizes the proposed ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm with partially hidden-policy, decryption test, and traceability, to encrypt her/his travel data. An authorized driver can successfully decrypt the ciphertext to acquire the passenger's travel data, then drive to the point of departure and wait for the passenger. Second, the data stored on the blockchain, such as the hash value of the ciphertext and the storage address of the ciphertext, can be used for digital forensics to achieve the distributed storage and traceability of data. Third, a reputation management based on the drivers' past behavior is proposed, which is a quantitative method to forecast the reliability of the drivers' future behavior and can be applied to settle the trust issue between passengers and drivers. Furthermore, the security analysis and performance comparisons manifest that the proposed DPSRM scheme is secure and efficient in ride-sharing services.",1937-9234,,10.1109/JSYST.2022.3211710,,,IEEE

To further understand recent advances in blockchain-based FL (BFL) systems, this article aims to provide a systematic survey to deconstruct BFL systems.

For some complicated tasks, essential features are owned by different data sellers offering data by blockchains. With limited budgets, buying features are crucial steps in knowledge discovery tasks in electricity spot markets, especially for learning based algorithms. However, there are lack of proper data pricing mechanisms tailored to dynamic learning processes. Besides, existing methods cannot efficiently employ edge computing servers to obtain optimal policies for selecting features according to dynamic pricing with limited budgets. To overcome such drawbacks, a data pricing mechanism is proposed in this paper, which consists of static and dynamic pricing parts.

Ohtsuki,China,"['Heilongjiang University', 'Keio University']",2021.0,"With the rapid development of information technology, the multi-source heterogeneous data containing meaningful information have been significantly generated by various edge devices in Internet of Energy, which is one of essential foundations of many knowledge discovery tasks based on edge computing. For some complicated tasks, essential features are owned by different data sellers offering data by blockchains. With limited budgets, buying features are crucial steps in knowledge discovery tasks in electricity spot markets, especially for learning based algorithms. However, there are lack of proper data pricing mechanisms tailored to dynamic learning processes. Besides, existing methods cannot efficiently employ edge computing servers to obtain optimal policies for selecting features according to dynamic pricing with limited budgets. To overcome such drawbacks, a data pricing mechanism is proposed in this paper, which consists of static and dynamic pricing parts. Based on this mechanism, given limited budgets, a feature selection algorithm considering multiple new factors is proposed, which offers near optimal solutions for feature selection at different scenarios.

789,789,Low-Latency Hardware Architecture for VDF Evaluation in Class Groups,D. Zhu; J. Tian; M. Li; Z. Wang,China,['Nanjing University'],2022.0,"The verifiable delay function (VDF), as a kind of cryptographic primitives, has recently been adopted quite often in decentralized systems. Highly correlated to the security of VDFs, the fastest implementation for VDF evaluation is generally desired to be publicly known. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a low-latency hardware implementation for the complete VDF evaluation in the class group by jointly exploiting optimizations. On one side, we reduce the required computational cycles by decreasing the hardware-unfriendly divisions and increase the parallelism of computations by reducing the data dependency. On the other side, we provide low-latency large-number divisors, multipliers, and adders, respectively, while those operators are generally very hard to be accelerated. Besides, we carefully schedule the sub-modules and devise the low-latency architecture for the complete VDF evaluation. Finally, the proposed design is coded and synthesized under the TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology. The experimental results show that our design can achieve a speedup of 3.5x compared to the optimal C++ implementation for the VDF evaluation over an advanced CPU. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art hardware implementation for the squaring, a key step of VDF, we achieve about 2x speedup.",1557-9956,,10.1109/TC.2022.3219723,,,IEEE

However, the impacts of these subsidies on the mask supply chain (MSC) operations are unclear. Motivated by our interview with a mask manufacturer as well as the observed real-world practices, we establish consumer utility-based stylized models to analytically examine government subsidies and policies in the MSC. We utilize the infection transmission model to capture the social health risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. The government aims to maximize social welfare, which includes the manufacturer's profit, consumer surplus, social health risk, and government subsidy expenditure. Results indicate that when the price is not controlled (i.e., the manufacturer decides it), the manufacturer and consumer subsidy programs are equally efficient in enhancing consumer surplus as well as reducing harm to social health risk under COVID-19. Thus, the government can conduct a subsidy scheme that is easier to implement in practice. However, we surprisingly find that the government's excessive intervention will cause disequilibrium in the MSC. When the price or the manufacturer's dishonest behavior is fully controlled by the government, subsidizing the MSC is not always advisable. Besides, our findings are consistent with the public interest theory; that is, the proper implementation of dishonesty prevention and pricing control policies can improve social welfare but sacrifice consumer surplus.

Quan,NC,[],2022.0,"This paper proposes a novel lattice-based aggregate signature (LAS) scheme that bring post-quantum security to the Bitcoin system without sacrificing its transaction efficiency. Bitcoin currently employs Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is insecure against the emerging quantum technology, so post-quantum signature schemes like the proposed LAS will become necessary in the near future. However, most of the post-quantum signatures schemes have large signature sizes which decrease Bitcoin’s efficiency while our proposed scheme does not have this negative side effect. Our LAS scheme is based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and a zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (STARK) protocol. CRYSTALS-Dilithium is the most prominent algorithm chosen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), yet it still has an adverse limitation: it would cause Bitcoin’s transaction efficiency to fall by 17 times due to its relatively large signature size. On the other hand, the proposed LAS scheme takes full advantage of signature aggregation using the STARK protocol and Dilithium’s easy and fast implementation, thus generating signatures with post-quantum security and small signature sizes which are critical to transaction efficiency. Our proofs convey the correctness, compactness, and post-quantum security of our construction in the quantum random oracle model, and our implementation conveyed that the proposed scheme would only decrease Bitcoin’s transaction efficiency by 3 times, a significant improvement from using Dilithium and other lattice-based aggregate signature schemes.

798,798,Blockchain Assisted Federated Learning for Enabling Network Edge Intelligence,Y. Wang; J. Zhou; G. Feng; X. Niu; S. Qin,,[],2022.0,"The recently emerging federated learning (FL) exploits massive data stored at multiple user nodes to train a global optimal learning model without leaking the privacy of user data. However, it is still inadequate to learn the global model safely at the centralized aggregator, which is an essential part for the traditional FL architecture. Specifically, when using FL in radio access networks to enable edge intelligence, it is difficult for a central server, which belongs to a third party, to guarantee its credibility. Moreover, because the central server may cause a single point of failure, its reliability is also difficult to guarantee. Besides, a malicious participating node of FL may send ill parameters for model aggregation. In this article, we develop a blockchain assisted federated learning (BC-FL) framework, with aim to overcome the single point of failure caused by central server. Meanwhile, we propose to use blockchain to implement auditing of individual involved nodes to ensure the reliability of learning process. To avoid privacy leakage during the audit process to the greatest extent, we design a matching audit mechanism to realize efficient random matching audit process. A cryptocurrency free delegated byzantine fault tolerant (CF-DBFT) consensus mechanism is also designed to realize the low-latency distributed consensus of all nodes in the FL proces. We apply the proposed BC-FL framework to resolve the computing resource allocation problem at the edger servers in MEC network. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance superiority of the proposed BC-FL framework.

Network virtualization based on software-defined networking (SDN-NV) in clouds makes it possible to realize programmable virtual networks; consequently, this technology offers many benefits to cloud services for tenants. However, to the best of our knowledge, network monitoring, which is a prerequisite for managing and optimizing virtual networks, has not been investigated in the context of SDN-NV systems. As the first framework for network monitoring in SDN-NV, we identify three challenges: non-isolated and inaccurate statistics, high monitoring delay, and excessive control channel consumption for gathering statistics. To address these challenges, V-Sight introduces three key mechanisms: 1) statistics virtualization for isolated statistics, 2) transmission disaggregation for reduced transmission delay, and 3) pCollector aggregation for efficient control channel consumption. The evaluation results reveal that V-Sight successfully provides accurate and isolated statistics while reducing the monitoring delay and control channel consumption in orders of magnitude.

Li,China,['Guangzhou University'],2022.0,"Deep neural networks are increasingly used as the critical component of applications, bringing high computational costs. Many practitioners host their models on third-party platforms. This practice exposes DNNs to risks: A third party hosting the model may use a malicious deep learning framework to implement a backdoor attack. Our goal is to develop the realistic potential for backdoor attacks in third-party hosting platforms. We introduce a threatening and realistically implementable backdoor attack that is highly stealthy and flexible. We inject trojans by hijacking the built-in functions of the deep learning framework. Unlike existing backdoor attacks, the proposed sequential trigger is a specific sequence of clean image sets. Moreover, our attack is model agnostic and does not require retraining the model or modifying the parameters. Its stealthy is that injecting trojans will not change the models prediction for a clean image. Its flexibility lies in that adversary can remodify the trojan behavior at any time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks with different frameworks demonstrate that our attack achieves a perfect success rate. And we can inject multiple trojans which do not affect each other at the same time. Analysis and experiments further show that state-of-the-art defenses are ineffective against our attacks.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2022.3164073,,,IEEE

822,822,Communication Security Analysis of Intelligent Transportation System Using 5G Internet of Things From the Perspective of Big Data,Y. He; M. Kong; C. Du; D. Yao; M. Yu,China,['China University of Political Science and Law'],2022.0,"The transportation system has entered the era of 5G intelligent Internet of things (IoT), which can realize the comprehensive monitoring, perception, and intelligent decision-making of people, vehicles, roads, and the environment. The purpose is to solve the problems in the communication security of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and improve the vulnerability of traditional distributed architecture. The security issues of the Internet of vehicles (IoV) in 5G environment are analyzed from the perspective of big data. An access control mechanism based on risk prediction is proposed aiming at the problems existing in the node access control process. A Wasserstein Distance-based Combined Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN) is proposed. It modifies the loss function to solve the gradient disappearance problem, and a combination of multiple generators is designed to solve the pattern collapse. The simulation experiment is carried out on the dataset of the intrusion detection evaluation project. The WCGAN model has the smallest prediction error than the other models regarding the node packet transmission rate. Its loss value is close to 0 after 10 iterations, while the loss value of the BP neural network (BPNN) is about 0.28. The prediction accuracy of the WCGAN model can reach 86.3% when the training set is 5000, which is much higher than that of BPNN (77.8%). The reason is that the WCGAN model increases the number of generators according to GAN, which improves the low accuracy caused by pattern collapse. The IoT-based ITS can implement corresponding strategies according to the prediction results and control the access rights of nodes, thus ensuring the security of information resources effectively. The research content reduces the communication delay under ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information in the process of data transmission, and provides a reference for ensuring the safe communication of IoV.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3141788,,,IEEE

824,824,Denial-of-Service Vulnerability of Hash-based Transaction Sharding: Attack and Countermeasure,T. Nguyen; M. T. Thai,United States,['University of Florida'],2022.0,"Since 2016, sharding has become an auspicious solution to tackle the scalability issue in legacy blockchain systems. Despite its potential to strongly boost the blockchain throughput, sharding comes with its own security issues. To ease the process of deciding which shard to place transactions, existing sharding protocols use a hash-based transaction sharding in which the hash value of a transaction determines its output shard. Unfortunately, we show that this mechanism opens up a loophole that could be exploited to conduct a single-shard flooding attack, a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, to overwhelm a single shard that ends up reducing the performance of the system as a whole. To counter the single-shard flooding attack, we propose a countermeasure that essentially eliminates the loophole by rejecting the use of hash-based transaction sharding. The countermeasure leverages the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to let blockchain's validators securely execute a transaction sharding algorithm with a negligible overhead. We provide a formal specification for the countermeasure and analyze its security properties in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept is developed to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our solution.",1557-9956,,10.1109/TC.2022.3174560,,,IEEE

On the other hand, blockchain based smart contracts have become very popular nowadays for automatizing legal transactions. They eliminate the need of mediators to verify a process and secure the same using digital signatures. Moreover, the in-built immutable nature of the blockchain makes it difficult to compromise its security. A “Hyperledger Fabric” bib1 based blockchain framework is used in this work to solve the locational constraints of cloud based services and guarantee a compliant geographical transfer of the cloud data when required. Our contribution towards configuring the hyperledger network and designing the chaincodes guarantee an organization wise segregation of the location information and prevent illegitimate users from accessing the same. Add-on security measures including port segregation, TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates and access control rules are implemented to secure the configuration files, chaincodes and ledgers, respectively.

Unfortunately, counterfeiting of intellectual property becomes a prominent threat as many 3D designs are accessible online, combined with the proliferation of cheap consumer 3D printers that enable malicious actors to produce non-authentic parts. State-of-the-art techniques to secure manufacturing processes mostly rely on watermarking, which embeds hidden information inside CAD models to prove ownership and authenticity. Nevertheless, such techniques tamper with the model itself, while existing attacks allow removing such watermarks altogether. To address these shortcomings, we integrate signal processing and cryptographic techniques and describe a tailored solution for CAD model ownership and supply chain management. Our approach generates unique identifiers for 3D designs using frequency-domain transforms and employs non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that persist on public distributed ledgers. Our NFTs are implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and their functionality is twofold: (a) authenticate the owner of a CAD model, and (b) enable ownership transfer.

Deng,Singapore,"['Fujian Normal University', 'University of Oregon', 'Xian University of Posts and Telecommunications', 'Nanyang Technological University', 'Singapore Management University']",2021.0,"To reduce the cost of human and material resources and improve the collaborations among medical systems, research laboratories and insurance companies for healthcare researches and commercial activities, electronic medical records (EMRs) have been proposed to shift from paperwork to friendly shareable electronic records. To take advantage of EMRs efficiently and reduce the cost of local storage, EMRs are usually outsourced to the remote cloud for sharing medical data with authorized users. However, cloud service providers are untrustworthy. In this paper, we propose an efficient, secure, and flexible EMR sharing system by introducing a novel cryptosystem called dual-policy revocable attribute-based encryption and tamper resistance blockchain technology. Our proposed system enables EMRs to be shared at a fine-grained level and allows data users to detect any unauthorized manipulation. Moreover, the key generation center can revoke malicious users without affecting the honest users. We provide the formal security model as well as the concrete scheme with security analysis.

834,834,Bitcoin P2P Network Measurements: A testbed study of the effect of peer selection on transaction propagation and confirmation times,B. G. Gebraselase; B. E. Helvik; Y. Jiang,Norway,['Norwegian University of Science and Technology'],2022.0,"Bitcoin is the first and the most extensive decentralized electronic cryptocurrency system that uses blockchain technology. It uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to operate without a central authority and propagate system information such as transactions or blockchain updates. The communication between participating nodes is highly relying on the underlying network infrastructure to facilitate a platform. Understanding the impact of peer formation strategies, peer list, and delay is vital in understanding node to node communication and the system performance. Therefore, we performed an extensive study on the transaction characteristics of Bitcoin through a testbed. The analysis shows that peer selection strategies affect the transaction propagation and confirmation times. In particular, better performance, in terms of smaller transaction confirmation time and lower number of temporary forks, may be achieved by adjusting the default nearby-based peer selection strategy.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3216955,,,IEEE
835,835,Performance and Security Analysis of Distributed Ledger Under the Internet-of-Things Environments with Network Instability,Z. Chen; X. Chen; Y. Li,China,"['Chongqing University of Technology', 'Chongqing University of Post and Telecommunications']",2022.0,"Applying blockchain technology to the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment can significantly enhance the privacy protection of information and enable trusted sharing of data. However, the classic Proof-based blockchain systems have problems such as unsatisfactory system throughput, low consensus efficiency and excessive computing resource consumption, making it difficult to directly apply them to the IoT environment. The recently proposed Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) represented by Tangle is designed based on the logical structure of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which significantly improves the transaction confirmation delay and system throughput, making it more suitable for IoT scenarios. This paper focuses on the performance and security of Tangle DLT in IoT applications with network instability. Such unstable network environment can be caused by the pre-defined node working mode or signal interference, which leads to the status switching between online (work-mode) and offline (sleep-mode) of nodes or unstable data transmission. Firstly, a Markov chain based model is established to analyze the time delay of block propagation in the underlying network under different status switching rate, different generation rates of blocks, different nodes’ average uplink bandwidths and different number of neighbor nodes. Next, the impact of block propagation delay on the consensus efficiency and system throughput is analyzed. Furthermore, we also analyze the influence of block propagation delay on the attacker’s decision to conduct a double-spending attack under different network load, and deduce the suitable moment for the attacker to broadcast the parasite chain to maximize the probability of successful attack. Finally, through detailed numerical simulations, the experimental results comprehensively reveal the performance and security of the Tangle system in the unstable network environment. This paper provides a valuable reference for the deployment and performance improvement of Tangle DLT in practical scenarios.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3216586,,,IEEE

Dulay,UK,[],2022.0,"To guarantee delivery of their intended functionalities in the presence of unresponsive parties, current smart-contracts cut users off from being able to commit their responses after a fixed period of time has elapsed. However, current blockchains have limited transaction processing capacities, so a fixed amount of time will not always be sufficient to receive every (C-TX). This paper presents a mechanism for adaptive cutoffs (ACs) which ensures that users retain the opportunity to commit despite blockchain congestion, and enables early cutoffs when the number of required is low. A non-interactive argument system for setting adaptive cutoffs under the current Ethereum Virtual Machine is described. Additionally, disputable cutoffs (DCs) are presented, which are a more efficient approach used in parallel to ACs based on a bisection-based dispute. Furthermore, it’s empirically demonstrated that an AC/DC-enabled smart-contract can receive a larger number of than its non-adaptive counterparts when user responsiveness is slowed due to denial of service or congestion.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2022.3195064,,,IEEE

However, the current consensus algorithms are not suitable for the previous architecture mentioned above. Therefore, this paper proposes a parallel consensus mechanism based on the DAG-lattice structure in the IoV using Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) as consensus algorithm. This mechanism solves the problem of low efficiency of PBFT caused by too many consensus nodes and the mobility of nodes by adopting the method of network sharding, and meanwhile to ensure that transactions can be reached on consensus parallelly. To avoid the selection of primary nodes from being predicted in advance, this paper proposes a primary node selection method based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF). Moreover, a method is proposed of selecting transactions based on Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduling to motivate nodes for the purpose of maintaining a high reputation score. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is verified by experiments whose results show that the proposed consensus mechanism shows better performance than other comparable schemes in terms of the time added to the blockchain, Transaction Per Second (TPS), consensus success rate, and the time of obtaining transaction.

Compared with traditional proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain systems like Bitcoin, EOSIO achieves a high transaction throughput and an alleged decentralization with the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. However, recent reports claimed the existence of voting collusion and manipulation during the DPoS consensus procedure of EOSIO, which may greatly decline the decentralization degree, fault tolerance, and reliability of the whole system. In this article, we obtain data from up to 135 000 000 blocks of EOSIO and conduct a data-driven decentralization analysis. Specifically, we characterize the decentralization evolution of the two phases in DPoS, namely block producer election and block production. Moreover, we study the voters with similar voting behaviors and propose methods to discover abnormal mutual voting behaviors in EOSIO. The analysis results show how EOSIO gradually evolves from decentralization to oligopoly and our methods can effectively capture abnormal voting phenomena in the EOSIO, which can also provide important insights for the design and maintenance of other DPoS-based blockchains.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3191350,,,IEEE

To this end, this paper aims to depict the roadmap to the Metaverse in terms of communication and networking in 6G, including illustrating the framework of the Metaverse, revealing the strict requirements and challenges for 6G to realize the Metaverse, and discussing the fundamental technologies to be integrated in 6G to drive the implementation of the Metaverse, including intelligent sensing, digital twin (DT), space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN), multi-access edging computing (MEC), blockchain, and the involved security issues.",1558-0687,,10.1109/MWC.019.2100721,1.0,,IEEE
852,852,FRAMH: A Federated Learning Risk-Based Authorization Middleware for Healthcare,C. Mazzocca; N. Romandini; M. Colajanni; R. Montanari,Italy,['University of Bologna'],2022.0,"Modern healthcare systems operate in highly dynamic environments requiring adaptable access control mechanisms. Access to sensitive data and medical equipment should be granted or denied according to the current health situation of the patient. To handle the need for adaptable access control of healthcare scenarios, we propose a novel model that allows dynamic access control decisions based on the context characterizing the source, type of access request, patient, and estimated risk corresponding to the conditions of the patient. Estimating patient status risk requires analyzing vital physiological data whose availability is growing, thanks to the widespread diffusion of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. Inferring the patient health status risk through machine learning (ML) techniques is possible, but to achieve better accuracy, the training phase requires the aggregation of vast amounts of data from different sources. This aggregation could be difficult or even impossible due to organization regulations and privacy laws. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel federated learning risk-based authorization middleware for healthcare (FRAMH) that supports risk-based access control to deal with changing and unforeseen medical situations. Our solution infers the risk of health status through a federated learning (FL) approach enriched with blockchain to avoid the weaknesses of centralized servers. The implemented prototype and a large set of experimental results demonstrate the advantages of FL in estimating the risk in healthcare scenarios. Through this approach, even a medical institution with a limited dataset can achieve a satisfying risk estimation and efficient access control enforcement.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3210372,,,IEEE

Qin,China,"['Hong Kong Baptist University', 'The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology']",2022.0,"Bitcoin network is one of the most popular blockchain systems. Mining pools are the main components of the Bitcoin network that invest a large amount of computing power to maximize their expected mining payoffs, which guarantees the security of the Bitcoin network. Although many existing works about mining pools are available, the long-term evolution of mining pools, and their effects on both the Bitcoin system and end-users, remain to be investigated. To fill this gap, we trace over 2.54 hundred thousand blocks from Feb 2016 to Nov 2020 and collect over 12 million unconfirmed transactions from Mar 2018 to Nov 2020. We then conduct a broad range of analyses, including the pool evolution, labeled transactions, and labeled blocks. We make the following observations from our measured data: 1) A few mining pools control most of the peer-to-peer network's computing power. 2) The long-term computing power of top mining pools grows exponentially while its continuous-time mining strategy decreases linearly. 3) The computing power of the Bitcoin network converges to the Nash equilibrium. We then propose game-based strategies for mining activity analysis, i.e., the best-response strategies for mining pools when the mining revenue increases or decreases sharply. Moreover, we study the transaction fee dilemma of mining pools and the transaction fee strategies for end-users. Our models and analysis can help to understand and improve the Bitcoin system quantitatively.",2327-4697,,10.1109/TNSE.2022.3210537,,,IEEE

Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) provides deep learning methods to optimize the resource scheduling problem, but faces great challenges of security and reliability. On one hand, DLaaS training agents and raw data are exposed to various adversarial attacks. On the other hand, dishonest DLaaS trainers can generate poisoned models to attack the DLaaS system. In this paper, we propose SAPE, a Secure and decentralized DLAaS Platform in Edge computing. SAPE allows users to submit their tasks, which will be scheduled to the appropriate edge clusters to minimize the task execution time. We formulate the resource scheduling problem and develop the federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to optimize the problem and resist the adversarial attacks of DLaaS. We utilize blockchain and propose a consortium-based verification scheme to improve the reliability of the federated training process, protecting the DLaaS models from being poisoned and compromised.

882,882,Boosting Query Efficiency of Meta Attack with Dynamic Fine-tuning,D. Lin; Y. -G. Wang; W. Tang; X. Kang,China,"['Guangzhou University', 'Sun YatSen University']",2022.0,"In black-box attack, excessive queries to target model may cause suspicion and expose attacker's identity. Equipped with advanced meta learning technique, Meta Attack simulates the target model with a surrogate model, significantly reducing the queries. However, it queries for ZOO-gradients to correct the estimated meta-gradients with a fixed frequency, thereby still leading to massive unnecessary queries. To overcome this limitation, this letter takes the dynamic changes of the accuracy of the estimated gradients as a starting point, and develops a Dynamic Meta Attack (DMA). At the beginning of each fine-tuning round, DMA computes the distance between the above two types of gradients. Such distance metric can reflect the accuracy of the meta-gradients, and guide the dynamic adjustment of query frequency for the ZOO-gradients. Moreover, the working flow of the dynamic fine-tuning process can be controlled by a set of parameters, which are of physical significance and easy to be tuned. By this means, DMA merely launches queries at critical moments, greatly saving query resource. Experiments conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 show that the proposed DMA requires far fewer queries than existing methods while maintaining a satisfying attack success rate and distortion.

User only needs to draw a pattern on a radio frequency identification tag array, while four biometrics can be collected simultaneously. Specifically, we first design a gradient-based pattern recognition algorithm to precisely extract user’s secret pattern. Then, a convolutional neural network-and long short-term memory-based classifier is utilized for user recognition. Furthermore, to guarantee the systemic security, an anti-replay method called Binary ALOHA is proposed to detect replayed signals. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 volunteers. The experiment results show that BioDraw can achieve high authentication accuracy (with a 2% $-$  false reject rate) and is effective in defending against various attacks.",1558-2566,,10.1109/TNET.2022.3208002,,,IEEE

Moreover, current methods typically suffer from undesired facial details loss due to the adoption of the de-facto standard encoder–decoder architecture without any skip connections (SCs). In this article, we directly learn and exploit geometric constraints and propose a fully deformable network to simultaneously model the deformations of both landmarks and faces for face synthesis. Specifically, our model consists of two parts: a deformable landmark learning network (DLLN) and a gated deformable face synthesis network (GDFSN). The DLLN converts an initial reference landmark to an individual-specific target landmark as delicate pose guidance for face rotation.

In this way, individual-aware pose changes are explicitly modeled in the face generator to cope with geometric transformation, by adaptively focusing on pertinent regions of the source face. To compensate for offset estimation errors, we introduce a soft-gating mechanism for adaptive fusion between deformable features and primitive features.

Xu,China,"['Zhengzhou University', 'Guangzhou University', 'Hong Kong Baptist University']",2022.0,"The booming of mobile internet and crowdsourcing technology has offered great opportunities for first and last mile logistics (FLML) service. Unlike the traditional FLML service that separates the parcel collection in the first mile from the parcel delivery in the last mile, a new type of crowdsourced FLML service integrates parcel collection and parcel delivery services as a whole, which can significantly improve the efficiency of FLML service. Briefly, in a crowdsourced FLML service, the platform assigns the customers' triggered pick-up parcels to the couriers who are delivering drop-off parcels in terms of the real-time status of couriers (e.g., capacity, location, and schedule). Existing works solving the crowdsourced FLML problem only consider the utility maximization for the platform but ignore the incentive to the utilities of couriers. Inspired by this, in this paper, we investigate a novel type of crowdsourced FLML problem, namely Auction-based Crowdsourced FLML (ACF), where the platform assigns the couriers with suitable pick-up parcels based on the preferences of couriers with the goal of maximizing the social welfare of the platform and couriers. To solve the ACF problem, we present a novel auction model named Multi-attribute Reverse Vickrey (MRV), where the couriers bid on parcels according to their preferences for parcels. Based on the MRV model, we present three efficient assignment algorithms to assign parcels to couriers. In addition, we give theoretical analysis for our proposed algorithms.

902,902,S-MFRL: Spiking Mean Field Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation of D2D Networks,P. -G. Ye; Y. -G. Wang; W. Tang,China,['Guangzhou University'],2022.0,"Device-to-device (D2D) technology has been widely used to address the mobile traffic explosion problem due to its ability of direct communications between proximal devices. In practice, the available spectrum is often limited. With the rapid increase of D2D users and cellular users, the efficiency of resource allocation would be dramatically reduced. To overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes a spiking mean field reinforcement learning framework (S-MFRL) to optimize the resource allocation of D2D networks. Firstly, spiking neural network (SNN) cooperated with deep reinforcement learning is trained for channel selection and power control. Secondly, spatio-temporal backpropagation is adopted to accelerate the SNN training. Thirdly, mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MFRL) is applied to approximate interactions among D2D users. By this means, the optimization process of resource allocation becomes tractable as the number of D2D users increases, which solves the problem of exponential growth of user interactions. Two algorithms are implemented under the S-MFRL framework by integrating MFRL into spiking actor-critic (S-AC) and spiking proximal policy optimization (S-PPO), which are named S-MFAC and S-MFPPO, respectively. Experimental results show that our designed S-MFAC and S-MFPPO outperform both AC and PPO in terms of convergence rate, access rate, time-averaged overall throughput, and collision probability. Besides, further simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the case of larger action space and hundreds of D2D users.

903,903,Unsupervised Learning-Based Framework for Deepfake Video Detection,L. Zhang; T. Qiao; M. Xu; N. Zheng; S. Xie,China,['Hangzhou Dianzi University'],2022.0,"With the continuous development of computer hardware equipment and deep learning technology, it is easier for people to swap faces in videos by currently-emerging multimedia tampering tools, such as the most popular deepfake. It would bring a series of new threats of security. Although many forensic researches have focused on this new type of manipulation and achieved high detection accuracy, most of which are based on supervised learning mechanism with requiring a large number of labeled samples for training. In this paper, we first develop a novel unsupervised detection manner for identifying deepfake videos. The main fundamental behind our proposed method is that the face region in the real video is taken by the camera while its counterpart in the deepfake video is usually generated by the computer; the provenance of two videos is totally different. Specifically, our method includes two clustering stages based on Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) and noiseprint feature. Firstly, the PRNU fingerprint of each video frame is extracted, which is used to cluster the full-size identical source video (regardless of its real or fake). Secondly, we extract the noiseprint from the face region of the video, which is used to identify (re-cluster for the task of binary classification) the deepfake sample in each cluster. Numerical experiments verify our proposed unsupervised method performs very well on our own dataset and the benchmark FF++ dataset. More importantly, its performance rivals that of the supervised-based state-of-the-art detectors.",1941-0077,,10.1109/TMM.2022.3182509,,,IEEE

Although existing image forgery localization methods could achieve fairly good results on several public datasets, most of them perform poorly when the forged images are JPEG compressed as they are usually done in social networks. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a self-supervised domain adaptation network, which is composed of a backbone network with Siamese architecture and a compression approximation network (ComNet), is proposed for JPEG-resistant image forgery detection and localization. To improve the performance against JPEG compression, ComNet is customized to approximate the JPEG compression operation through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images with general JPEG compression characteristics. The backbone network is then trained with domain adaptation strategy to localize the tampering boundary and region, and alleviate the domain shift between uncompressed and JPEG-agent images. Extensive experimental results on several public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms or rivals to other state-of-the-art methods in image forgery detection and localization, especially for JPEG compression with unknown QFs.",1939-3539,,10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3210379,,,IEEE

912,912,GaSaver: A Static Analysis Tool for Saving Gas,Z. Zhao; J. Li; Z. Su; Y. Wang,China,['Xian Jiaotong University'],2022.0,"Smart contracts are programs running on Ethereum, whose deployment and use require gas. Gas measures the cost of performing specific operations as an index designed to quantify the computing power consumption. Existing unoptimized smart contracts make contract developers and users spend extra gas. To save gas and optimize smart contracts, this paper proposes a new tool named GaSaver for automatically detecting gas-expensive patterns based on Solidity source code. Specifically, we first identify 12 gas-expensive patterns in smart contracts and classify them into three categories: storage-related, judgment-related, and loop-related. Then, we deploy gas-expensive patterns and group them into three levels according to gas waste degree. By conducting extensive experiments on real data sets, we find that 89.68% of the 1172 smart contracts suffer from gas-expensive patterns, 94.27% of 1100 new smart contracts are gas-expensive, and 80.56% of 72 widely used smart contracts are affected. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed GaSaver can effectively optimize smart contracts. Besides, the proportion of gas-expensive cases in widely used smart contracts is lower than that in the newly released smart contracts.",2377-3782,,10.1109/TSUSC.2022.3221444,,,IEEE

925,925,A Privacy-Preserving Solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems: Private Driver DNA,G. Costantino; M. D. Vincenzi; F. Martinelli; I. Matteucci,Italy,[],2022.0,"The rising connection of vehicles with the road infrastructure enables the creation of data-driven applications to offer drivers customized services. At the same time, these opportunities require innovative solutions to protect the drivers’ privacy in a complex environment like an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This need is even more relevant when data are used to retrieve personal behaviors or attitudes. In our work, we propose a privacy-preserving solution, called Private Driver DNA, which designs a possible architecture, allowing drivers of an ITS to receive customized services. The proposed solution is based on the concept of Driver DNA as characterization of driver’s driving style. To assure privacy, we perform the operations directly on sanitized data, using the Order Revealing Encryption (ORE) method. Besides, the proposed solution is integrated with ITS architecture defined in the European project E-Corridor. The result is an effective privacy-preserving architecture for ITS to offer customized products, which can be used to address drivers’ behaviors, for example, to environmental-friendly attitudes or a more safe driving style. We test Private Driver DNA using a synthetic dataset generated with the vehicle simulator CARLA. We compare ORE with another encryption method like Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and some other privacy-preserving schemas. Besides, we quantify privacy gain and data loss utility after the data sanitization process.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3217358,,,IEEE

The first thing is user engagement. Metaverse relies heavily on massive online users to realize its social value. In other words, user engagement is the foundation of the metaverse ecosystem. Therefore, our research uses Nova Empire as a case study, aiming at understanding metaverse engagement via complexity analysis of social patterns and reward mechanisms. Specifically, the behavioral data of 46 954 players in September 2021 are used for analysis. Our observations show that social behavior is not the main factor for user engagement. Then, we perform a correlation analysis of trigger times for different gaming behaviors to verify the above observations. The results prove that the main factors affecting user engagement are game tasks and reward mechanisms in the early stage and social gaming behaviors environment with alliances in the middle and late stages. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future games and propose operation strategies on user engagement to improve the metaverse ecosystem and other online social space.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3211679,,,IEEE

Marchetto,Italy,['Nantes University'],2022.0,"Recent medical applications are largely dominated by the application of Machine Learning (ML) models to assist expert decisions, leading to disruptive innovations in radiology, pathology, genomics, and hence modern healthcare systems in general. Despite the profitable usage of AI-based algorithms, these data-driven methods are facing issues such as the scarcity and privacy of user data, as well as the difficulty of institutions exchanging medical information. With insufficient data, ML is prevented from reaching its full potential, which is only possible if the database consists of the full spectrum of possible anatomies, pathologies, and input data types. To solve these issues, Federated Learning (FL) appeared as a valuable approach in the medical field, allowing patient data to stay where it is generated. Since an FL setting allows many clients to collaboratively train a model while keeping training data decentralized, it can protect privacy-sensitive medical data. However, FL is still unable to deliver all its promises and meets the more stringent requirements (e.g., latency, security) of a healthcare system based on multiple Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For example, although no data are shared among the participants by definition in FL systems, some security risks are still present and can be considered as vulnerabilities from multiple aspects.

Such problems necessitate the introduction of a solution that is capable of managing products, maintaining ownership, facilitating trading, and delivering products in a traceable, auditable, and trustworthy manner. In this article, we propose a nonfungible-token-based solution for the management of healthcare products, where the ownership of a product is maintained by using digital certification, the trade and delivery of healthcare products is facilitated by a smart contract, and disputes are settled by an arbitrator while keeping all related information on-chain for auditing purposes. We utilize the Interplanetary File System to store the metadata of healthcare products to avoid storing large-sized data on the blockchain. We present system diagrams and algorithms along with the implementation details. We conduct security testing to demonstrate that our solution is resilient and secure against common vulnerabilities and exploits.

Identifiers (ID) are always attached to them to trace running instances or entities in logs. Therefore, log messages can be grouped by the same IDs to help anomaly detection and localization. The existing approaches to achieve this still fall short meeting these challenges: 1) Log is solely processed in single components without mining log dependencies. 2) Log formats are continually changing in modern software systems. 3) It is challenging to detect latent performance issues non-intrusively by trivial monitoring tools. To remedy the above shortcomings, we propose SwissLog, a robust anomaly detection and localization tool for interleaved unstructured logs. SwissLog focuses on log sequential anomalies and tries to dig out possible performance issues. SwissLog constructs ID relation graphs across distributed components and groups log messages by IDs. Moreover, we propose an online data-driven log parser without parameter tuning. The grouped log messages are parsed via the novel log parser and transformed with semantic and temporal embedding.

Predicting such critical points is important to give warnings to system managers to take precautionary measures aimed at achieving high resource utilization, quality of service (QoS), and profit of the investment. Existing researches mainly focus on point value prediction only, whereas trend-based turning point prediction is not considered. This is partly due to the fact that traditional trend prediction methods have a weak ability to represent the cloud features, which means that they cannot describe the highly-variable cloud workloads time series. This paper introduces a novel cloud workload turning point prediction approach based on cloud feature-enhanced deep learning. Firstly, we establish a turning point prediction model of cloud server workload by taking cloud workload features into consideration. Then, a cloud feature-enhanced deep learning model is designed for workload turning point prediction.

Detailed security analysis demonstrates that the proposed T-SGX achieves the goal of secure distributed computing without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties. Finally, we benchmark the framework in six real-world applications, and the experimental results show that T-SGX significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art solution, with 11.9%-29.7% less overhead performing an SGX-based application.",1939-1374,,10.1109/TSC.2021.3123511,,,IEEE

The ICO enables the venture to collect demand information from decentralized investors. The venture makes a tradeoff between ensuring the project’s success and forecasting market demand through token size and token price. We find that the higher the demand uncertainty and production cost, the greater the venture’s incentive to learn from its investors. To identify when the venture has an incentive to raise funds through an ICO, we compare it with traditional bank financing and analyze the venture’s preference between the two financing options. The results show that when demand uncertainty is high, an ICO can provide both financing and information benefits, whereas when demand uncertainty is low, although the venture does not collect information through an ICO, it can still get financing benefit. Only when demand uncertainty is intermediate, the venture prefers bank financing. In addition, we find that although the revenue sharing effect of the ICO results in an underinvestment issue, it can also alleviate the loss caused by the increased cost of production. Therefore, with high information accuracy, as production cost goes up, ICOs become more attractive than bank financing for the venture.",1558-0040,,10.1109/TEM.2021.3075073,,,IEEE

Due to the massive integration of SSTs into critical infrastructure, their security has raised major concerns. In this work, we develop a security model for the family of SST system protocols to formally prove that traditional SST systems are not resilient against cyber-attacks. We create a comprehensive inventory of attacking configurations against SSTs. We then use this inventory to verify that enhanced resilience against compromising any major component of an SST system can be achieved via three steps: a) replacing free-range APIs with multi-signature transaction tokens; b) switching from networking interfaces in SSTs into direct device-to-device channels; and c) adding a bootstrapping service. We introduce Offline Self-Service Things (OSST), which have high attack resilience by maintaining a distributed representation without the need to be online. To enable the real-world applicability of OSSTs, we develop <sc>AutoThing</sc>, a transaction framework for OSSTs.

Routing, which finds feasible paths between the senders and receivers, is critical for PCNs. However, existing solutions either fail to achieve high scalability that can maintain low storage/computation/network communication overhead, or they are susceptible to privacy disclosure. In this paper, we propose, a service-oriented routing solution for PCNs, which adopts a set of service nodes to alleviate the per-user burden of routing and achieves more comprehensive privacy guarantees than the state-of-the-art by leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs). demands users communicate with the TEE by the secure channel to protect the privacy of transaction value. Then, an oblivious path mechanism is designed to construct redundant paths with the pseudo senders and receivers generated by TEEs to confuse its untrusted controller. Further, we report a novel attack that allows malicious service nodes to drop the valid paths for profit, and design a feedback mechanism to relieve it. Moreover, hides the identities of the senders/receivers for the intermediate nodes of payment paths by introducing a novel identity information transfer scheme called encrypted identity chain.

The keyword guessing attack is a typical user privacy threat model, that is, an adversary could guess the user’s retrieval keyword given a search trapdoor. On the other hand, the emergence of quantum computers make traditional PEKS schemes no longer secure. Although scholars put forward some postquantum secure PEKS schemes, these schemes are based on lattice cryptography with a larger key size.

Ibekwe,Nigeria,[],2021.0,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding acceptance in the space community, especially Machine Learning (ML), a subdomain of AI. ML algorithms now find numerous applications in autonomous navigation, spacecraft health monitoring and operational management of satellite constellations. However, a large number of surveys on the applications of AI in space missions can be classified into two categories. The first category suffers from the limitation of being old and not covering some crucial and recent developments in the field; such as the contributions of Deep Learning (DL) and bioinspired AI algorithms. The challenge with the second category lies in its being too detailed with respect to the development and application of specific AI techniques or algorithms. These limitations have necessitated the need to have a concise survey with a wider scope for those interested in the applications and challenges of AI in the space industry, especially those with technical backgrounds in other fields. In this paper, we surveyed the use of traditional AI techniques in various domains of space missions without delving into formal methods. Some bioinspired AI algorithms were also surveyed and their potential application areas highlighted. Unlike similar surveys that focus only on technological challenges, we also addressed some crucial legal drawbacks that emanate from the reliance and use of AI in space. Summarily, while discussing future directions we reviewed some advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technologies. Our review prioritized three application domains positioned to benefit immensely from the inevitable AI-Blockchain convergence in the space community.

Traditional identifier systems encountered many problems, such as IP address exhaustion or difficulty in addressing and routing, which cannot meet the demands of numerous heterogeneous and interoperable Industrial Internet objects. At the same time, they also face various security risks. In this paper, we propose MIN-IIoT, a universal identifier system named multi-identifier network architecture for Industrial Internet, which supports the coexistence of multiple identifiers, such as identity, content names, services, locations, and IP addresses. MIN-IIoT establishes a unified identifier system and puts forward a series of identifier management methods, including identifier registration, addressing, mutual translation, and route forwarding. In addition, all identifier information is stored in a hierarchical consortium blockchain to ensure that they are authentic and immutable. Identity authentication, Proof of Vote (PoV) -based consensus algorithm, and trusted computing technology effectively protect the security of MIN-IIoT. Meanwhile, MIN-IIoT is convenient for deployment in various complex industrial field environments.

979,979,PIWS: Private Intersection Weighted Sum Protocol for Privacy-Preserving Score-Based Voting With Perfect Ballot Secrecy,S. Lu; Z. Li; X. Miao; Q. Han; J. Zheng,China,"['Information Engineering University', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'Ocean University of China']",2022.0,"This article proposes private intersection weighted sum (PIWS), a scalable, fair, and privacy-preserving intersection weighted sum protocol and applies it to voting scenarios. The PIWS protocol can privately calculate the intersection of identity index sets maintained by each participant and can privately calculate the weighted sum of the data associated with the identity indexes of the intersection set. After the execution of the protocol, both parties can only know the weighted sum, but not any additional information, such as any identity index or associated data of the other party. The PIWS protocol is very suitable for the privacy-preserving weighted voting scenarios and has three novel characteristics. First, it does not require as many semitrusted tally clerks as other protocols, which greatly reduces the deployment, communication, and calculation costs involved. It only requires the distributed deployment of voting servers and weight servers that are honest but curious. This is consistent with the deployment framework of the future big data application backgrounds. Second, perfect privacy protection and ballot secrecy are achieved. That is, the voting terminal or polling station provides encryption services for ballots immediately after each ballot is cast. All voting information is then expressed in ciphertext throughout the weighting and counting processes, until the final result of the weighted vote is passed to the voting server in the ciphertext. After decryption, the voting server only knows the results of the voting and it has no knowledge of the content or preference of the ballots, the privacy of the voters, or even the process of counting the votes. This design avoids the disclosure of voter privacy and ballot information, and the ciphertext form also prevents malicious users from cheating or tampering with voter or ballot information during the counting process. To better explain the security of our protocol, we present the provable security of the protocol under the honest-but-curious model and show the formal verification obtained using the Tamarin prover software. Third, our protocol not only achieves the function of an optional weighted voting protocol but also is relatively lightweight and efficient. The efficiency analysis results of the deployed voting system in terms of communication, storage, and calculation show that the protocol meets the requirements applicable to real-world applications. In summary, PIWS is superior to existing voting protocols in terms of function, security, and efficiency, and can be harmoniously applied to model updating of federated learning, consensus building of blockchain systems, or decision-making in artificial intelligence.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3162869,,,IEEE

Comprehending the way metaverse economy operates and the intrinsic value propping, it has become the key to the essence of metaverse. We try to reveal the value of metaverse via two academic resources, attention economy and media theory, and describe the principle of value creation in metaverse economy. To better examine how the value of NFT projects is affected by human time and attention devoted to metaverse, we first study systems with structured rules, e.g., blockchain games, to measure the players’ time spent and to quantify the players’ rewards. In addition, we investigate systems without dominant rules, in which the value of the NFTs relies more on users’ subjective valuation of their community symbols. Two representative projects, Aavegotchi and Bored Ape Yacht Club, are examined as cases of the above two scenarios. We analyze the data of NFTs such as price, time devoted, and the number of likes and acquire some meaningful findings of how NFTs drive prices up. Building on the above researches, we consider NFT systems as partly attention economy fused with finance and propose a theory of physical products combined with NFT collections to help set the value anchor of early metaverse.

Ozcan,India,"['National Defence University', 'Bogazici University', 'University of Defense in Belgrade']",2022.0,"Blockchain technology and metaverse advancements allow people to create virtual personalities and spend time online. Integrating public transportation into the metaverse could improve services and collect user data. This study introduces a hybrid decision-making framework for prioritizing sustainable public transportation in Metaverse under q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) context. In this regard, firstly q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) generalized Dombi weighted aggregation operators (AOs) and their characteristics are developed to aggregate the q-ROF information. Second, a q-ROF information-based method using the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) and stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) models are proposed to find the objective and subjective weights of criteria, respectively. Then, a combined weighting model is taken to determine the final weights of the criteria. Third, the weighted sum product (WISP) method is extended to q-ROFS context by considering the double normalization procedures, the proposed operators and integrated weighting model.

996,996,Building Resilience Through Foresight: The Case of Maritime Container Shipping Firms,H. Bathke; C. M&#x00FC;nch; H. A. von der Gracht; E. Hartmann,Germany,['Steinbeis University 71083'],2022.0,"Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains. Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firms’ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firms’ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario “picking the low-hanging fruit,” other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario “experiencing an era of dichotomy.” In the long-term scenario “overcoming the obstacles of the generational shift,” MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the experts’ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.",1558-0040,,10.1109/TEM.2021.3137009,,,IEEE
997,997,Internet Financial Fraud Detection Based on Graph Learning,R. Li; Z. Liu; Y. Ma; D. Yang; S. Sun,China,[],2022.0,"The rapid development of information technology such as the Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain has changed the transaction mode of the financial industry and greatly improved the convenience of financial transactions, but it has also brought about new hidden frauds, which have caused huge losses to the development of Internet and IoT finance. As the size of financial transaction data continues to grow, traditional machine-learning models are increasingly difficult to use for financial fraud detection. Some graph-learning methods have been widely used for Internet financial fraud detection, however, these methods ignore the stronger structural homogeneity and cannot aggregate features for two structurally similar but distant nodes. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a graph-learning algorithm TA-Struc2Vec for Internet financial fraud detection, which can learn topological features and transaction amount features in a financial transaction network graph and represent them as low-dimensional dense vectors, allowing intelligent and efficient classification and prediction by training classifier models. The proposed method can improve the efficiency of Internet financial fraud detection with better Precision, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$F$</tex-math> </inline-formula>1-score, and AUC.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3189368,,,IEEE

Wang,USA,"['Xidian University', 'University of Texas Rio Grande Valley', 'Northwestern Polytechnical University']",2022.0,"Global epidemics and international conflicts disrupt supply chain operations. Many enterprises employ emerging information technology (IT) to reduce supply chain vulnerability and enhance supply chain resilience. Technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain facilitate more robust supply chain operations, such as remanufacturing, just-in-time production, and automated workflow, leading to corporate sustainability along economic, environmental, and social dimensions. From a dynamic capability perspective, this article conceptualizes emerging IT capability and investigates its role in helping enterprises survive supply chain disruptions and prosper in the long run. A research model depicts the relationships among environmental uncertainty, supply chain vulnerability vigilance, emerging IT capability, supply chain resilience, and corporate sustainability. A partial least square analysis on survey observations collected from more than 200 enterprises in China that are highly susceptible to supply chain disruptions provides supporting evidence to most research hypotheses. The results show that high vigilance to potential supply chain disruptions will motivate enterprises to develop emerging IT capability, which will enhance supply chain resilience as well as economic, environmental, and social performances. The mediating role of emerging IT capability suggests a viable path for enterprises to adapt to the increasingly turbulent environment and improve supply chain resilience and corporate sustainability.",1558-0040,,10.1109/TEM.2022.3209613,,,IEEE
