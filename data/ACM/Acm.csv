Implementing a new blockchain-related feature implies moving to a platform with another database or duplicating its parts in a blockchain system. Both ways are difficult to migrate and maintain. The alternative is to implement blockchain features within the existing database, including consensus mechanisms and specific data structures for audit needs. The paper describes and evaluates a database extension with blockchain-related structures, leaving consensus beyond the scope. We use an account-based prototype of cryptocurrency as a model example. The proposed extension allows provably checking transaction content and user balance without a full database lookup.

Blockchain-based Supply Chain Financial Services Using Smart Contract,Xiaocong Yu,"College of Science, Hubei University of Technology","(Xiaocong Yu) FROM (College of Science, Hubei University of Technology)","Supply chain finance (SCF), a proposal to address financing problems of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), aims to make working capital optimized by utilizing credit and transaction information through cooperation between upstream and downstream in the supply chain. But some demerits such as information asymmetry and the lack of trust in financing scenarios could still be witnessed in supply chain finance. Blockchain technology, with the characteristics of asymmetric encryption, decentralization, nonrepudiation, and conducting transactions without the supervision of a trusted third party, has revolved multiple stages of development. Smart contracts are regarded as an important derivative technology of blockchain, which are automatically executed by the code between multiple parties through the blockchain without relying on a trusted institution. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based supply chain financial system combining smart contracts and main methods of supply chain financing to solve the disadvantages of SCF. We select three represented financing modes to design financing platforms with the introduction of smart contracts, and present our schemes in the form of specific pseudo code. All financing processes of supply chain are conducted on the basis of ethereum blockchain. This allows SMEs which have difficulty in capital turnover in the short term, or have insufficient credit to get financial loans more easily compared with traditional financing approaches due to merits of blockchain, and also this could facilitate supply chain to improve financing efficiency for SMEs.",China,25 February 2022,0,119,https://doi.org/10.1145/3510487.3510497

In addition to those who support, there are criticisms of the use of plea bargaining (such as too much discretion of prosecutors in plea bargaining, lack of legal substance that limits the possibility of abuse of authority by law enforcement officials, and the possibility of guilty plea not yet actual), but this criticism can be refuted through the use of blockchain technology in the mechanism of plea bargaining. In Indonesia, the regulation of the bargaining of corporate crime plea is still limited to the draft law. In fact, the draft is still not in accordance with the spirit of plea bargaining itself, such as the defendant whose plea bargaining application was received must still be tried through a short event examination, it does not regulate which types of criminal acts are categorized as special lines, bidding restrictions or negotiations between the defendant and the claimant general, and what form of waivers or rewards or concessions can be offered by public prosecutors.

Thus, most blockchain technologies assume an environment with a fast and stable network. However, in some blockchain-based systems, e.g., supply chain management (SCM) systems, some Internet of Things (IoT) nodes can only rely on the low-quality network sometimes to achieve consensus. Thus, it is critical to understand the applicability of existing consensus algorithms in such environments. We performed a systematic mapping study to evaluate and compare existing consensus mechanisms’ capability to provide integrity and security with varying network properties. Our study identified 25 state-of-the-art consensus algorithms from published and preprint literature. We categorized and compared the consensus algorithms qualitatively based on established performance and integrity metrics and well-known blockchain security issues. Results show that consensus algorithms that rely on synchronous network for correctness cannot provide the expected integrity. Such consensus algorithms may also be vulnerable to distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) and routing attacks, given limited network throughput. Conversely, asynchronous consensus algorithms, e.g., Honey-BadgerBFT, are deemed more robust against many of these attacks and may provide high integrity in asynchronous events.",Norway,02 October 2021,0,129,https://doi.org/10.1145/3475992.3475995

The double-spending phenomenon refers to the bifurcation of the blockchain structure. In the process of trusted transactions, the fork caused by malicious attacks will destroy the correctness, integrity, and consistency of the entire ledger, and causes serious economic losses to users. Therefore, eliminating double-spending attacks is an important issue to ensure the security of the blockchain. The current method of defending against double-spending attacks in trusted transactions mainly revolves around the Bitcoin blockchain system. In the process of researching the Nano blockchain grid project, a high-throughput trusted transaction system, we proposed a double-spending elimination solution for the system: the occupying mechanism. By using Java to reconstruct the Nano project and implement the occupying mechanism, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the occupying mechanism, and it is superior to the Nano project's double-spending solution based on the traditional voting mechanism in terms of time performance.",P.

As proof of concept, the blockchain technology is introduced in a smart community where consumers take part in energy trading among themselves as well as with the utility. In this paper, three use cases for P2P energy trading in a private blockchain network is discussed.

The Data Sharing Scheme based on Blockchain,"Xu Ma,Chen Wang,Laihua Wang","Qufu Normal University, Qufu,Qufu Normal University, Qufu,Qufu Normal University, Qufu","(Xu Ma) FROM (Qufu Normal University, Qufu),(Chen Wang) FROM (Qufu Normal University, Qufu),(Laihua Wang) FROM (Qufu Normal University, Qufu)","Data sharing is a vital method for data intensive and cooperative work-based applications. A central database system, which collects and stores data generated from different parties and provides open access, can not only save costs on infrastructures, but also provide consistent and uptodate data for all the participants. However, privacy and security issues also emerge especially when the shared data is highly sensitive, such as electronic medical records (EMRs). In this paper, we propose a new data sharing scheme with access control based on CP-ABE, searchable encryption, and blockchain. We realize two main goals in our scheme. First, data owners can share their data with multiple users who satisfy the access policy rather than just a single user. Second, the difficulty of the ciphertext query is overcome by means of searchable encryption technology. Most importantly, data owners do not need to interact with the data querier in the process of sharing. Both theoretical analysis and practical experiments show that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient.",China,06 October 2020,0,391,https://doi.org/10.1145/3384943.3409426

However, this algorithm meets its bottleneck, when there are a large number of nodes in the consortium blockchain net-work. In order to enhance the scalability of the consensus algorithm, this paper puts for-ward an advanced PBFT-based consensus algorithm, named ANPBFT, by taking ad-vantages of the message aggregation technology and tree topology technology. Specially, the consensus nodes in our proposed algorithm are divided into active nodes and passive nodes. Then, the consensus of block information is equivalent to the confirmation of iden-tity aggregation signature and aggregation promise of information key.

Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms.

It demonstrates that the 2PC blocking can be eliminated at a moderate financial cost, if the blockchain also meets the synchrony requirements. Otherwise, despite the blockchain being a reliable state-machine, eliminating 2PC blocking may well be impossible, depending on whether the cluster hosting the database is synchronous or not.

Towards Secure and Scalable Blockchain Technologies,Ghassan Karame,"NEC Laboratories Europe, Heidelberg","(Ghassan Karame) FROM (NEC Laboratories Europe, Heidelberg)","The blockchain technology is rapidly gaining grounds as a key technology, especially in the financial and supply chain management sectors. This is largely due to the ability of the technology to (i) efficiently manage the sharing of digital resources between a large number of stakeholders and (ii) to efficiently manage disputes arising in the process. In spite of its many advantages, experience with existing blockchain proposals reveals that there are still many challenges that need to be overcome prior to any large scale industrial adoption, namely [Scalability] Existing permissionless blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin) are able to scale to a considerable number of nodes at the expense of attained throughput (e.g., Bitcoin can only achieve few transactions per second[2]). On the other hand, permission-based blockchains can achieve relatively higher throughput, but can only scale to few hundred nodes. However, one needs to cater for both performance and scalability to meet industrial standards. [Privacy of lightweight clients] Most open blockchain platforms support lightweight clients, targeted for devices like smartphones, that only download and verify a small part of the chain. Here, clients connect to a full node that has access to the complete blockchain and can assist the client in transaction confirmation. As the full node has to learn all transactions issued and received by the requesting client to verify their correctness, such action obviously violates user privacy[1]. In this talk, we plan to overview a number of security challenges pertaining to existing blockchains-effectively capturing almost 8 years of research in this area of work. Moreover, we plan to discuss the performance limitations of existing blockchain-based consensus algorithms and explore different concepts leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enhance the scalability and security of existing consensus algorithms[3]. Finally, we will discuss the privacy provisions of existing lightweight client implementations and explore the solution space to enhance user privacy by leveraging functionality from TEEs[4].",Germany,25 May 2021,0,147,https://doi.org/10.1145/3457977.3460634

Using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain, as the underpinning technology, here we propose a conceptual model – ‘EvidenceChain’, through which citizens can anonymously upload digital evidence, having assurance that the integrity of the evidence will be preserved in an immutable and indestructible manner. Person uploading the evidence can anonymously share it with investigating authorities or openly with public, if coerced by the perpetrators or authorities. Transferring the ownership of evidence from authority to ordinary citizen, and custodianship of evidence from susceptible centralized repository to an immutable and indestructible distributed repository, can cause a paradigm shift of power that not only can minimize spoliation of evidence but human rights abuse too.

Because all virtual assets are bound to the players' own address, which allows the players to control and manage everything, players can trade virtual items via the 2nd exChange Market (2CM) directly. To understand the players' optimal strategies and the game provider's optimal pricing, we conduct an economic analysis of both the game provider's and players' behaviors. In addition, gas fee, a unique factor in blockchain, is taken into consideration. Specifically, we model the interactions between the game provider and players as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, we model the game provider's optimal pricing problem to maximize his utility using prospect theory (PT) due to the intrinsic demand uncertainty. In Stage II, the players choose the market which can maximize their utility to derive their preferred items. Moreover, our analysis and numerical results show that a game provider who considers the PT modeling should adopt a conservative pricing mechanism to increase his utility. Besides, the primary market is more susceptible to gas fees than the 2CM.",China,30 May 2022,0,84,https://doi.org/10.1145/3494106.3528675

An example of such is the commonly used Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, the security concerns with this protocol have presented vital security challenges in most IoT applications. For example, the MQTT protocol does not have secure authentication mechanisms implemented and leaves that task to the developer as all the included native security services are fragile. This paper will present a well-thought approach involving a lightweight authentication and authorization scheme together with a decentralized identity system to manage the users' identities. This mechanism helps in facilitating the authentication for both subscribers and publishers by utilizing a smart contract in Ethereum blockchain to guarantee trust, accountability and preserve user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to prove our work, which involves a decentralized MQTT platform and dashboard using our approach. The usability of this approach was further analyzed, particularly concerning CPU and memory utilization.

The future of machine learning is decentralized machine learning. Thus, many technological advance companies including Microsoft are also investing in researching approaches to decentralization in machine learning. With the upliftment of big data technology, designing optimized artificial intelligence algorithms is a must need. At the base of every machine learning algorithm we need data. Data is something that can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound or picture that is not being interpreted and analyzed. This data is not generated by just one party, multiple parties generate such data. The data will be geographically distributed amongst organizations. This pushes the need and research of distributed machine learning algorithms. In the current scenario, there is a central server which will run the machine learning algorithm and produce results, in this system obviously we need to collect all the data at that server itself. If the server is attacked then there is a problem of security of data. Also many organizations would not like to just lend their data to some third party. To address all such issues, we study all the possible ways for implementing a distributed machine learning system and propose a blockchain based distributed conservative system. Mainly, we design a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to learn a general predictive model over the trending blockchain technology, also taking care of Byzantine attack, using the within-N algorithm. Also analysis will be made on different machine learning algorithms and datasets as a part of testing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.",India,02 October 2021,0,121,https://doi.org/10.1145/3475992.3476003

Quantum Relay Blockchain and Its Applications in Key Service,Hui Chen,"Chengdu Liang'An Blockchain Technology Co., Ltd, Chengdu","(Hui Chen) FROM (Chengdu Liang'An Blockchain Technology Co., Ltd, Chengdu)","As a promising direction of cryptography, the feasibility of quantum key distribution has been widely verified. However, the bottle-neck problems encountered by quantum key distribution network, such as concurrent conflict of large-scale quantum relay links, relay delay and inconvenient access to applications, are still not solved completely. In order to solve these problems, a quantum relay blockchain scheme is proposed in this paper. In the scheme, each relay node in a target network negotiates a quantum key with everyone of its adjacent nodes respectively, and calculates the XOR values of any two quantum keys from these quantum keys, then encapsulates these XOR values into a transaction. A server encapsulates all the current transactions into a block based on which real-time quantum key services can be realized. Furthermore, the scheme can be easily employed to realize quantum key service in cloud platforms with unconditional security and high efficiency. The scheme, which can be used to overcome the bottle-neck of quantum key distribution network, will play a critical role in future world-wide quantum key service.",China,26 February 2020,0,183,https://doi.org/10.1145/3377644.3377657
Benchmarks and Models for Blockchain,Aad P A van Moorsel,"Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne","(Aad P A van Moorsel) FROM (Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne)","Blockchain is a highly popular paradigm for non-centralized applications, especially in finance and trade. Performance is a major challenge for blockchains, since consensus approaches are known not to scale. In this presentation we address blockchain performance, from the perspective of model-based prediction as well as benchmark-based assessment. We present research results about smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain and discuss the requirements for generic benchmarks for blockchain performance. Benchmarking is a common approach to compare industry-class systems. As blockchain technologies mature, the role of reliable benchmarks will become increasingly important. However, definitions of benchmarks for blockchains are still in their infancy. We argue that there is a clear need for benchmarks, and that benchmarks should be based on the sound scientific principles of metrology [1]. A variety of important performance issues should be addressed, including the performance of the proof (be it work, stake, or other), transaction processing and block creation. Moreover, in all these situations, establishing energy consumption benchmarks is critical in determining if incentives are in place for miners to operate the blockchain system. A particularly interesting element in some blockchains is the mechanism of smart contracts. For instance, in Ethereum, the fees associated with executing contracts depend on the benchmarked performance of the operation code. In [2] it was demonstrated that uncertainty with respect to the correctness of the anticipated execution time impacts the decisions miners will take. We will discuss improved benchmarking approaches for operational code.",United Kingdom,30 March 2018,2,816,https://doi.org/10.1145/3184407.3184441

Otherwise, the pool of unconfirmed (pending) transactions mempool could be overloaded, and it may cause DoS. In Bitcoin, users pay a fee for each transaction to address this issue.

These settings cover almost all voting scenarios that occur in practice. A proof-of-concept implementation for decentralized voting over Ethereum’s blockchain is presented. This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

The Realities of Blockchain-Based New Public Governance: An Explorative Analysis of Blockchain Implementations in Europe,Maik Brinkmann,"University of Potsdam, Potsdam","(Maik Brinkmann) FROM (University of Potsdam, Potsdam)","Blockchain technology and New Public Governance (NPG) represent promising concepts for various researchers. As such, both concepts offer the vision of an altered relationship between public administration and its non-public actors by emphasizing a strong position of non-public actors for public service delivery. This research aims to identify the relevance of NPG to leading blockchain implementations in the European public sector. For this purpose, both topics are combined in an explorative analysis. The analysis leverages an adapted analysis framework designed for this research effort to structure the expectations around NPG. Qualitative interviews with multiple key stakeholders of blockchain implementations projects were conducted to understand the actual impact of blockchain on the actor's relationships for public service delivery. This article presents the findings to this question and concludes that the use of blockchain has the changed actor relationships only in parts. Consequently, the author finally draws attention to the importance of blockchain governance and blockchain regulation for further developing the relationships of public administrations and their non-public counterparts.",Germany,11 July 2021,1,584,https://doi.org/10.1145/3462332
Proof of Stake Blockchain: Performance and Scalability for Groupware Communications,"Jason Spasovski,Peter Eklund","IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen,IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen","(Jason Spasovski) FROM (IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen),(Peter Eklund) FROM (IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen)","A blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger, a disruptive technology that creates new possibilities for digital ecosystems. The blockchain ecosystem maintains an immutable transaction record to support many types of digital services. This paper compares the performance and scalability of a web-based groupware communication application using both non-blockchain and blockchain technologies. Scalability is measured where message load is synthesized over two typical communication topologies. The first is 1 to n network -- a typical client-server or star-topology with a central vertex (server) receiving all messages from the remaining n - 1 vertices (clients). The second is a more naturally occurring scale-free network topology, where multiple communication hubs are distributed throughout the network. System performance is tested with both blockchain and non-blockchain solutions using multiple cloud computing configurations. We analyze the empirical results from each configuration to identify the costs and overhead of blockchain technology.",Denmark,07 November 2017,8,598,https://doi.org/10.1145/3167020.3167058

Maintaining CAs and revocation lists is demanding especially in loosely-connected and large systems. Log-based PKIs have been proposed as a remedy but they do not solve the problem effectively. We provide a general model and a solution for decentralized and dynamic PKI based on a blockchain and web of trust model where the traditional CA and digital certificates are removed and instead, everything is registered on the blockchain. Registration, revocation, and update of public keys are based on a consensus mechanism between a certain number of entities that are already part of the system. Any node which is part of the system can be an auditor and initiate the revocation procedure once it finds out malicious activities. Revocation lists are no longer required as any node can efficiently verify the public keys through witnesses included in the blockchain.",Sweden,22 April 2021,3,236,https://doi.org/10.1145/3412841.3442038

Indeed, the possibility that IoT devices participate in public shared transactions enables a lot of challenging applications. However, there are some aspects that may limit the use of Blockchain in IoT. These are mainly related to the low computational power and storage capabilities of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to implement a public ledger overcoming the above drawbacks, thus appearing more suitable to IoT applications.

IoT provides a medium for software part to interact with the physical part which is energy and transmission grid. IoT connects the physical battery containing the energy to the cloud database which is then used to interact with the software. IoT also enables the transfer of energy through the physical medium on the command given by the user through the user application. To make the system decentralized, blockchain is used, which helps to connect all the users in the network where they can transact without the need of knowing each other or having the obligation of any intermediary. Decentralisation helps in achieving a system which doesn't require any middleman and works on the cumulative trust of the nodes - often referred to as the Consensus-Based Algorithm. There are a number of such algorithms but Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are widely used for blockchains. We suggest using the PoW algorithm.

In recent years, many researchers have focused on developing optimal strategies to evaluate the impact of an adversary on the mining process using different attack situations such as selfish mining, double-spending, feather-forking, Denial of Service. These strategies rely on the use of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find optimal settings that an adversary can exploit to earn maximum profit in every round. However, these strategies do not consider a case where adversaries turn abusive, and their only aim is to harm the mining process without profit. Motivated by this, a self-defying adversary model is proposed that uses ZEBRA (Zero Expectation-Based Reward Abuse) strategy to cause a maximum impact on the rewards of the honest players at lower settings.

Evaluating Blockchain Protocols with Abusive Modeling,"Vishal Sharma,Paweł Szałachowski,Jianying ZHOU","Queen's University Belfast, Belfast,Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore,Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore","(Vishal Sharma) FROM (Queen's University Belfast, Belfast),(Paweł Szałachowski) FROM (Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore),(Jianying ZHOU) FROM (Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore)","Strategic evaluations of blockchain systems allow a better understanding of the security of the mining process. In recent years, many researchers have focused on developing optimal strategies to evaluate the impact of an adversary on the mining process using different attack situations such as selfish mining, double-spending, feather-forking, Denial of Service. These strategies rely on the use of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find optimal settings that an adversary can exploit to earn maximum profit in every round. However, these strategies do not consider a case where adversaries turn abusive, and their only aim is to harm the mining process without profit. Motivated by this, a self-defying adversary model is proposed that uses ZEBRA (Zero Expectation-Based Reward Abuse) strategy to cause a maximum impact on the rewards of the honest players at lower settings. With the proposed method, the adversary itself may not be profitable, but has better control over the chain growth and causes maximum damage to reward by delaying the blocks and inducing forks subject to its compliance degree.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication scheme in VANETs. We explore the strategy of a local blockchain for VANETs. We make use of a private blockchain for authentication and a public blockchain for managing event messages. The trusted authority (TA) is responsible for making the transactions in the private blockchain within the boundary of the countries, the transactions are the identity information required for authentication of vehicles when they join the network for the first time, the other vehicles have the right to read and check from the private blockchain the authenticity of a new vehicle. The public blockchain is used for storing the event messages within the boundary of pre-defined regions to ensure the security of message dissemination, we called this kind of blockchain road-side unit blockchain (RSU-BC) because it takes the role of RSU in a VANET. In this way, we eliminate the necessity of RSU's deployment in VANETs and reduce the dependency on the TA. By way of security analysis and security-proofing, we prove that our scheme satisfies multiple security and privacy requirements and can resist many attacks, while the performance analysis shows the efficiency of the scheme in terms of computation overheads and communication overheads.",China,07 March 2020,0,315,https://doi.org/10.1145/3377458.3377466
Blockchain-based RBAC for user authentication with anonymity,"Yongjoo Lee,Keonmyung Lee","ChungBuk National University,ChungBuk National University","(Yongjoo Lee) FROM (ChungBuk National University),(Keonmyung Lee) FROM (ChungBuk National University)","RBAC is a traditional approach of controlling who wants to access resources in a computer system through a permission to a role. Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can permanently record transactions. Smart Contract facilitates negotiations for a trustless transaction by enabling automatic payment. It is currently being applied to various kinds of business applications. In a smart contract that requires payment with cryptocurrency, if access control is performed only without individual authentication, progress for applications to various fields will be restricted. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based RBAC with an authentication mechanism that can provides role-based access control while also providing individual account-based authentication. We have defined three interfaces based on blockchain to realize it. The proposed mechanism provides anonymity-based authentication by using a hash function with a pass that is indistinguishable from the owner. This was simulated on an Ethereum-based test network and compared with existing methods. The proposed mechanism not only added authentication methods, but also was more efficient in gas use and performance time than the existing RBAC model.",Korea,24 September 2019,8,363,https://doi.org/10.1145/3338840.3355673
GDPR-Compliant Use of Blockchain for Secure Usage Logs,"Valentin Zieglmeier,Gabriel Loyola Daiqui","Technical University of Munich,Technical University of Munich","(Valentin Zieglmeier) FROM (Technical University of Munich),(Gabriel Loyola Daiqui) FROM (Technical University of Munich)","The unique properties of blockchain enable central requirements of distributed secure logging: Immutability, integrity, and availability. Especially when providing transparency about data usages, a blockchain-based secure log can be beneficial, as no trusted third party is required. Yet, with data governed by privacy legislation such as the GDPR or CCPA, the core advantage of immutability becomes a liability. After a rightful request, an individual’s personal data need to be rectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain. To solve this issue, we exploit a legal property of pseudonymized data: They are only regarded personal data if they can be associated with an individual’s identity. We make use of this fact by presenting P3, a pseudonym provisioning system for secure usage logs including a protocol for recording new usages. For each new block, a one-time transaction pseudonym is generated. The pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees unlinkability and enables proof of ownership. These properties enable GDPR-compliant use of blockchain, as data subjects can exercise their legal rights with regards to their personal data. The new-usage protocol ensures non-repudiation, and therefore accountability and liability. Most importantly, our approach does not require a trusted third party and is independent of the utilized blockchain software.",Germany,21 June 2021,0,141,https://doi.org/10.1145/3463274.3463349

Enabling IC Traceability via Blockchain Pegged to Embedded PUF,"Md Nazmul Islam,Sandip Kundu","University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA,University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA","(Md Nazmul Islam) FROM (University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA),(Sandip Kundu) FROM (University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA)","Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain.

It has transformed several industries by enabling processes to work in a secure and decentralized manner. Blockchain consists of blocks that are linked together through cryptography. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that contains a set of sequenced blocks of data. Each block records transaction data in a transparent, immutable, and secure fashion. Consensus algorithm is the key part of this technology as it is used for the decision-making process among nodes in the blockchain network. Nodes in the verifying network use consensus algorithm to reach mutual agreement about state of the blockchain whenever a new block is added. This makes it possible to accept any transaction in the blockchain. Many consensus algorithms have been proposed in the literature each having its own performance and security characteristics. In this paper, we present a pattern for one of the most widely used blockchain consensus algorithms, which is the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm.

VOLTimebank: A Volunteer System for Mutual Pension Based on Blockchain,"Shuzhi Cheng,Wenxuan Shi,Hualong Zhang","JinNan,JinNan,JinNan","(Shuzhi Cheng) FROM (JinNan),(Wenxuan Shi) FROM (JinNan),(Hualong Zhang) FROM (JinNan)","With the process of the population aging, the problem of the aged in the urban is becoming increasingly prominent in China, especially the shortage of pension resources. In order to solve this problem, we proposed Volunteer time bank (VOLTimebank) based on blockchain, a novel distributed ledger that allows transactions without any third party organization. VOLTimebank is a record management system to handle volunteer service records. The system provides a channel for volunteers to serve the elderly and gives volunteers a way to exchange the services they can offer today with the services that they hope to get in the future. And a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism is used to select auditors, whose main task is to audit volunteers' services. Each holder of the (volunteer medals (VOLMedals) has the right to vote for auditors and be voted to be an auditor. As a proof of concept, we present a prototype implementation of VOLTimebank via smart contracts based on Ethereum. VOLTimebank is a true realization of ""Serve today, enjoy tomorrow"", encouraging more people to take part in the volunteer services, for the elderly and for themselves. This paper is intended to illustrate the ideas and methods of VOLTimebank.",Tianjin,15 March 2019,1,222,https://doi.org/10.1145/3320154.3320160

Traditional cloud-based access control solutions are based on a centralized approach (i.e. a cloud server becomes the central authority to control accesses to the data), which makes it difficult to prevent malicious cloud servers from disclosing user’s data; and therefore compromising the privacy of the stored data. Additionally, the centralization of authority can cause a single point of failure. Furthermore, to provide confidentiality, which is one of the essential security requirements, user’s data is encrypted before it is stored on the cloud. Most of the cloud servers store the decryption keys, after they encrypt the data, in their premises. This compromises data privacy. In this paper we propose a new model that addresses the aforementioned issues. To address the centralization problem, we distributed the access control tasks to smart contracts over a decentralized network, i.e. blockchain.

Integrating blockchain technology into the accounting information system can not only break the development restrictions of the accounting information system, but also realize the sharing of resource information among enterprises in the industry, including existing customers and suppliers. However, due to the openness and transparency of blockchain technology, there have been speculations similar to the free-rider problem among corporate accounting entities. The author uses game theory to analyze speculative behavior among accounting entities based on blockchain technology. Through analyzing the prisoner's dilemma, the selection tendency of the interests represented by each node on the blockchain is obtained after the game. Based on the boxed pig game analysis, it is concluded that under the influence of factors such as optimal prices, sales prices, negotiation costs, and production costs, larger companies in the same industry will take the initiative to negotiate prices with customers. By contrast, under the influence of factors such as optimal prices, purchase prices, and negotiation costs, larger companies in the same industry will first negotiate prices with suppliers. Given this analysis, in order to avoid speculative behaviors disrupting economic development, this paper will propose countermeasures including legal constraints, institutional punishments, privacy protection, policy support, etc., to achieve a smooth transition of integrating blockchain technology into the accounting information system.",GuangZhou,04 January 2021,1,47,https://doi.org/10.1145/3444370.3444621

In this talk, I will present an absurdly simple consensus protocol called Streamlet. The entire protocol is: every epoch, a leader proposes a block extending the longest chain it has seen so far. Everyone votes for (i.e., signs) the first block proposed by the leader if it extends from one of the longest notarized chains they have seen so far. When a block collects votes from 2/3 of the nodes, it becomes notarized. Notarized does not mean final. Finality is decided with the following rule: for any chain in which all blocks are notarized and moreover, the last three blocks have consecutive epoch numbers, the entire chain except the first block is final. Streamlet is inspired by the community's past five years of work on consensus motivated by decentralized blockchains. To the best of our knowledge, it is the simplest embodiment known thus far, and it subsumes classical landmark protocols such as PBFT/Paxos and their numerous variants. It is a great fit for pedagogy. Streamlet has been incorporated into courses at universities such as Stanford and CMU.

Insurance agencies may provide support to sustain maintenance costs. Spare parts suppliers can schedule the delivery of mechanical parts required for maintenance interventions. In this scenario, trust among participants becomes a critical issue.

In this paper, we focus on developing a fast and cost-effective framework based on blockchain technology and machine learning for the health insurance industry. Blockchain is capable of removing all third-party organisations by forming a smart contract, making the entire process more smooth, secure, and efficient.

In areas with dense base station deployment or low mobile traffic, SPBSs store surplus energy, which, in most instances, gets lost due to limited charge storage capacity of the batteries. To limit the wastage of energy, an appropriate mechanism enabling the utilization of excess energy produced by these base stations can be adopted. To this end, we model a Base Station-to-Grid (BS2G) network in which the grid can utilize surplus energy spared by the SPBSs. To overcome challenges in regards to scalability, robustness, and cost-optimization, we propose using the blockchain technology to create the BS2G network. Blockchain is a distributed ledger designed to record transactions in a transparent, lightweight, and tamper-proof manner. To make energy trade between base stations and the grid cost-effective, a game-theoretical approach has also been adopted in this paper. The proposed model simplifies the process of energy trading while also making it cost-optimal.",Australia,11 October 2020,3,117,https://doi.org/10.1145/3397166.3412800

Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a large number of products and will positively impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe. In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of ""altcoins"" which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code.

It employs the blockchain in two ways: as data storage, and to implement a rewarding mechanism for pieces of content that are relevant to the users. Employing a rewarding system based on the social activity of the users can have a strong impact on how people socialise. In this work, we study the interaction among the users of Steemit in terms of incremental patterns. In detail, we propose a set of incremental patterns, by using variants of patterns proposed in the literature and by defining a new pattern specifically thought for the scenario of Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM). This paper's findings show that social interactions in BOSMs are highly conditioned by the presence of bots, and the patterns proposed can detect previously undetected complex interactions.",Italy,06 May 2022,0,38,https://doi.org/10.1145/3477314.3507037

These applications are known as ÐApps. When engineering ÐApps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective ÐApps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., ÐApp developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8m. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan’s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap transaction. EthGasStation’s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, ÐApp developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.",Canada,19 July 2022,0,74,https://doi.org/10.1145/3549542

With T-Tracer, each party of data delivery embeds its digital fingerprint into the byte sequence of the shared data by generating a tailor-made symbol mapping table, whereby the watermarking can handle any type of data. A blockchain network overlaying all data sharing participants serves as a trusted third party to ensure the credibility of T-Tracer.

It is designed to prevent arbitrary manipulation by operators of distributed nodes and contains a list of changes that records the continuously changing data on the participating nodes. Currently, various blockchain-based services are appearing. in particular, blockchain-based medical convergence services are emerging worldwide. In a blockchain-based medical environment, hospitals, departments, doctors and patients must frequently update and use all public and private key pairs to minimize the leakage of personal information. As such, key pairs management is of great importance. To securely manage keys in such a medical environment, hierarchical deterministic wallet is used. Defined as Bitcoin's BIP32 standard, it is currently the most commonly used technology and allows hospitals to easily derive and manage the key of departments, doctors and patients. In addition, if the hospital, which is at the root level, backs up the first seed value, the doctor and patient can easily recover the key in the future, in case it is lost. However, problems have been found with hierarchical deterministic wallets. The attacker can infer the doctor's private key by obtaining doctor's public key, chain code, or the patient's index and private key. In addition, there is a privilege escalation attack that can be acquired up to the department or hospital's private key. Subsequently, an attacker can leak personal information, such as the personal information of doctors or medical records of managed patients. That is why the current BIP32 standard does not include the function to derive lower public keys from the higher public keys. In this scheme, we maintain the functionality removed from BIP32. In addition, we propose a secure scheme of hierarchical deterministic key generation scheme in blockchain-based medical environment by preventing privilege escalation attack.",South Korea,25 August 2020,0,78,https://doi.org/10.1145/3409934.3409958

This paper proposes a new algorithm for blockchain software developers and architects to use for determining what computations of a smart contract can be effectively done off-chain without loss of trust. Our algorithm uses FSMs or HSMs in order to create smart contract patterns using graphs and then uses pattern recognition to identify which parts of the smart contracts should be considered for moving off-chain. The pattern recognition property used is that once software execution transits into the pattern's entry state, off-chain execution continues until the execution transits into the pattern's exit state, when execution continues on-chain. The software developer reviews each pattern together with information, such as anticipated overhead cost due to off-chain execution, and she is provided with guidance on decision making whether to execute the smart contract pattern under consideration off-chain. Expert software developer inspection, in the context of a Trade Finance use case, validates that our algorithm finds optimal patterns for moving computations off-chain and improve blockchain software performance.",Canada,20 July 2021,0,69,https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460565

An ETA is a spoofing attack wherein a malicious actor creates a convincing copy of a wireless network Access Point (AP) by duplicating a Service Set ID (SSID) and/or corresponding Message Access Control (MAC) addresses. We introduce TrustedAP: A blockchain-based solution that provides means for clients' (End Users') verification of AP devices as trustworthy using minimal (if any) connected time. We intend to use the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts as a medium for an End User to challenge an AP's trustworthiness. Next, the AP (or AP trust-managing entity) delivers a sound, unique response to both the blockchain via smart contract and the requesting End User by a network channel. The End User validates an AP response using cryptographic integrity-preserving tools alongside an additional capacity for auditing an AP ownership chain. Once validated, clients have a very strong reason to believe that their connection is trustworthy, genuine, and under positive control of the intended public WiFi provider.",USA,05 March 2021,1,0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3439695

Patients often lose their data and medical history if they must move between hospitals. In these cases, other health care providers must repeat some procedures, such as analyses and x-rays. An approach that focuses on securely managing and sharing patient health records is thus required. As traditional centralised systems in hospitals do not meet the requirements for such an approach, this calls for the implementation of a secure structure that is capable of protecting patient data. One potential solution is the use of decentralised personal health records in a system that would allow the patient to own, manage and access their own data. This can be achieved by using the type of blockchain technology that would permit patients to identify shareable information and grant or prevent providers and other entities from accessing their data.

"Blockchains: Past, Present, and Future",Arvind Narayanan,"Princeton University, Princeton, NJ","(Arvind Narayanan) FROM (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ)","Blockchain technology is assembled from pieces that have long pedigrees in the academic literature, such as linked timestamping, consensus, and proof of work. In this tutorial, I'll begin by summarizing these components and how they fit together in Bitcoin's blockchain design. Then I'll present abstract models of blockchains; such abstractions help us understand and reason about the similarities and differences between the numerous proposed blockchain designs in a succinct way. Here is one such abstraction. Blockchains can be understood in terms of (1) a log of messages: for example, a ledger of financial transactions; (2) the state that summarizes the result of processing the log: for example, a set of account balances; (3) a set of validity rules for messages/state updates: for example, transactions must spend no more than the available balances, must have verifiable signatures, etc; (4) consistency rules that determine whether two views of the log by different participants on the network are consistent with each other. In the second half of the tutorial I'll describe several research directions, focusing on those likely to be of interest to the PODS community. Here are a few examples. Efficient verification of state. A participant might want to verify a statement about a small part of the global state, such as the inclusion of a particular transaction in the blockchain. While the basics have been worked out, and involve techniques such as hash pointers, Merkle trees, and other ""authenticated data structures"", many interesting questions remain. Reconciling different views of consensus. In the game theory view of blockchains, all players are rational and follow their incentives; there are no honest, faulty, or malicious players. When does this view lead to similar or different predictions compared to the traditional consensus literature? Can we come up with hybrid models that reconcile these assumptions? Scaling and sharding. In traditional designs, the blockchain is fully replicated by every node, leading to massive inefficiency and severely limiting transaction throughput. What are the fundamental limits to scaling, and how can we improve scalability without weakening security? In particular, is it possible to shard the blockchain, that is, partition it among subsets of nodes, given the Byzantine setting?",USA,27 May 2018,1,"1,004",https://doi.org/10.1145/3196959.3197545

However, the recent 51% attacks render this assumption unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we challenge this assumption against rational miners in the PoW-based blockchains in reality. In particular, we show that the current incentive mechanism may encourage rational miners to launch 51% attacks in two cases. In the first case, we consider a miner of a stronger blockchain launches 51% attacks on a weaker blockchain, where the two blockchains share the same mining algorithm. In the second case, we consider a miner rents mining power from cloud mining services to launch 51% attacks. As 51% attacks lead to double-spending, the miner can profit from these two attacks. If such double-spending is more profitable than mining, miners are more intended to launch 51% attacks rather than mine honestly.",Australia,04 June 2021,0,115,https://doi.org/10.1145/3433210.3453087

To elucidate this point, we took the case of India, where multiple beneficiary-oriented programmes are implemented in rural areas of the country targeting about a billion people. Billions of dollars are spent by both Federal Governments and State Governments in undertaking similar exercises for outreach, identification, and enrolment of beneficiaries under various welfare programmes that provide cash transfers, subsidies and other social services to the disadvantaged youth, women and aged in society. Some countries have also undertaken household surveys to identify gaps in demand and the supply of government services. However, limited success has been achieved in adopting such static database as the single source of truth for the identification of deprived households across all government programmes, due to its inherent potential for creating errors of inclusion and exclusion. Another major deterrent in the adoption of such a singular identity associated with socio-economic attribute is the concentration of information and associated risks. Through this paper, an attempt is being made to bridge this ‘trust deficit’ in governance through the application of distributed ledger technology for social inclusion. We further discuss how government is better placed than the private sector to tap the full potential of Blockchain technology as several public organizations working in the same sector are often controlled by the same parent government department. A mandate from government can give the necessary thrust to reap the benefits of this ecosystem-centric technology. At the last, feasibility, approaches and challenges are analyzed.

Therefore in order to work through and realize the potential of the blockchain and its transferability across society we need to find means to open up and reduce its 'ineffable' nature. This paper presents and reflects on an approach that made the complexity of the blockchain understandable or 'effable' using physical modeling. The design-based approach adopted a tangible system of Lego and colored stickers to allow participant-actors to physically enact transactions on a Blockchain Lego 'block'. This modeled simplification was not designed as a comprehensive or accurate explanation of Bitcoin and Blockchain but rather as a prompt for opening up rich dialogue and insightful lines of questioning.",United Kingdom,13 July 2015,18,"1,387",https://doi.org/10.1145/2783446.2783593

"Is a ""Decentralized Autonomous Organization"" a Panopticon?: Algorithmic governance as creating and mitigating vulnerabilities in DAOs",Kelsie Nabben,"Blockchain Innovation Hub RMIT University Melbourne, VIC","(Kelsie Nabben) FROM (Blockchain Innovation Hub RMIT University Melbourne, VIC)","This piece explores algorithmic governance as a strength and a vulnerability in the experience of building participatory communities known as ""Decentralized Autonomous Organizations"". The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation and built cryptographically secure blockchain-based infrastructure to counter this threat. Now, not just on chain transactions are being tracked but every move of participants in blockchain communities. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if mis-used for social control. This piece analyzes the ways in which decentralization efforts can be a threat to themselves by exploring the question, 'Are ""Decentralized Autonomous Organizations"" (DAOs) the next panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in ""autonomous"" systems?'.

In this study, we designed a scalable data access control method for blockchains; this method extends the storage forms of the blockchain to support the chaining and sharing of large files, ensures that the traceable data in the chaining process cannot be tampered with, and introduces the attribute authority mechanism in peer nodes to improve the reliability and efficiency of attribute authorization. To verify the correctness and security of the method, we built a complete prototype system based on the Hyperledger Fabric license chain and performed rigorous evaluations on the indicators of physical resource consumption and performance using the Hyperledger Caliper evaluation model.

Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that the integration of blockchain and smart contract technologies to FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present FL-MAB (FL- Multi-Auction using Blockchain), a client selection mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. FL-MAB employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract. This allows FL-MAB to measure the relative contribution of each client by calculating a Shapley value, and allocating rewards accordingly.

Firstly, this paper analyzes the possible improvements of several elliptic curves applied to IOT, such as the creation of keys without specific numbers, characters and corresponding sources of account numbers; the scheme designed in this paper can realize the confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation of data at the same time. At the same time, this scheme is designed according to the characteristics of IOT, so these two schemes are suitable for solving the security problem of communication messages in IOT.",China,18 July 2022,0,5,https://doi.org/10.1145/3544109.3544348

DIV: Resolving the Dynamic Issues of Zero-knowledge Set Membership Proof in the Blockchain,"Zihuan Xu,Lei Chen","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","(Zihuan Xu) FROM (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong),(Lei Chen) FROM (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong)","Zero-knowledge set membership (ZKSM) proof is widely used in blockchain to enable private membership attestation. However, existing mechanisms do not fully consider dynamic issues in the blockchain scenario. Particularly, frequent addition/removal of set elements, not only brings the significant cost to keep public parameters up to date to provers and verifiers but also affects mechanism efficiency (e.g., generation time of the proof and verification, etc.). In this paper, we propose DIV to shard elements on blockchain into independent subsets with the same cardinality to reduce the effect of dynamic issues. However, due to the diverse proof frequency, an improper element-set assignment can result in frequently used elements being easily inferred and corrupted. Thus, we formalize the assignment problem under both element addition and removal cases as two optimization problems and prove their NP-hardness. For each problem, we consider two cases if each element proof frequency is known in advance by the set maintainer or not, and propose solutions with theoretical guarantees. We implement DIV on both Merkle tree and RSA-based ZKSM mechanisms to evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness and apply DIV on a ZKSMbased application named zkSync to demonstrate its applicability. Results show that DIV can achieve O(1) time/space cost on ZKSM under dynamic situations while protecting the information about frequently used elements. It also notably reduces the system latency of zkSync.",China,18 June 2021,2,492,https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3457248

However, Blockchain is not a social computing technology a priori; instead to emerge as one, much effort and work is required to radically transform existing domains, including wrestling with traditions, standards, and legacy. In this article, we expand on previous work on Blockchain as an information infrastructure, and on the notion of infrastructural grind. Infrastructural grind allows us to analytically explore how the emerging Blockchain technology is appropriated into established business domains, in our case the shipping industry. We present ethnographic data unpacking three different accounts of infrastructural grind taking place at the intersection of the shipping and the Blockchain information infrastructures. The results demonstrate that infrastructural grind occurs as a result of various infrastructuring activities taking place at different intersections between the two infrastructures and is constituted of the sum of these activities. We propose a framework in which infrastructural grind is constituted of three entangled dimensions: permeability, interoperability, and velocity. These socio-technical dimensions relate to infrastructural properties such as legacy, embeddedness, and standards, as well as to technical properties of specific solutions deployed at specific points of infrastructural grind. Our analysis shows that these dimensions are enacted differently along the shipping supply chain, and depending on the dynamic interplay between them at various points of infrastructural grind. At different points in time, the infrastructural grind between Blockchain and the shipping domain will thus manifest itself differently and at differential velocity.",København,13 December 2018,4,316,https://doi.org/10.1145/3288800

These features make it harder to manage the system, and previous protection mechanisms such as physical separation and network isolation are not applicable any more. To mitigate the security risks without sacrificing the benefits of IIoT, we propose DL-DP, the decentralized ledger defined perimeter for IIoT.

However, analogous decentralized measures to regulate the replication level of the associated transactions and blocks data are completely missing so far. We argue that such measures are required as well. On the one hand, the smaller the number of replicas, the higher the vulnerability of the system against compromises and DoS-attacks. On the other hand, the larger the number of replicas, the higher the storage overhead, and the higher the operational blockchain cost are. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, EWoK (Entangled proofs of WOrk and Knowledge), that regulates in a decentralized manner the minimum number of replicas that should be stored by miners in the blockchain. EWoK achieves this by tying replication to the only directly-incentivized process in PoW-blockchains -- which is PoW itself. EWoK only incurs small modifications to existing PoW protocols and is fully compliant with the specifications of existing mining hardware. Our implementation results confirm that EWoK can be easily integrated within existing mining pool protocols, such as GetBlockTemplate and Stratum mining, and does not impair the mining efficiency.",Germany,11 June 2021,0,66,https://doi.org/10.1145/3450569.3463564

To summarize and organize the insights of research in information systems (IS) on how BCT relates to transparency and, ultimately, sustainability of supply chains, this paper conducts a structured literature review. In total 46 articles have been identified and analyzed. The analysis shows that the potential of BCT to facilitate transparency in supply chains and thus enable sustainability measures stems from its decentralized and distributed nature. Further, BCT does not unfold this potential on its own; rather it is a technology that complements existing IS used to manage inter-organizational transactions. Overall, the paper contributes to the literature by providing a deeper insight into the possibilities, features, and merits of BCT in the SCM context, mainly focusing on transparency and sustainability matters. Summarizing and organizing the advantages of BCT and the shortcomings of existing IS used in SCM as discussed in prior research, this paper emphasizes that BCT needs to be considered as a complementary technology.

While the security of these services is often well-researched, security implications of their required bootstrapping processes are usually neglected: Users either jointly conduct the anonymization themselves, or they need to rely on a set of non-colluding privacy peers. However, the typically small number of privacy peers enable single adversaries to mimic distributed services. We thus present AnonBoot, a Sybil-resistant medium to securely bootstrap distributed anonymity services via public blockchains. AnonBoot enforces that peers periodically create a small proof of work to refresh their eligibility for providing secure anonymity services. A pseudo-random, locally replicable bootstrapping process using on-chain entropy then prevents biasing the election of eligible peers. Our evaluation using Bitcoin as AnonBoot's underlying blockchain shows its feasibility to maintain a trustworthy repository of 1000 peers with only a small storage footprint while supporting arbitrarily large user bases on top of most blockchains.",Germany,05 October 2020,2,120,https://doi.org/10.1145/3320269.3384729

In the present study, a block chain-based passive defense model is proposed to protect the model. To be specific, when a participant updates its local model, model participation, user fingerprints and other key information will be stored on the chain. Malicious attacks can be therefore traced and detected. To ensure data integrity and confidentiality, model data is encrypted and updated via the blockchain.

The next generation of blockchain services are now storing more and more data on distributed ledgers. Therefore, the need to perform analytic queries over blockchains is more evident than ever. However, despite the wide public interest and the release of several frameworks, efficiently accessing and processing data from blockchains is challenging. This paper introduces Datachain, a lightweight, flexible and interoperable framework deliberately designed to ease the extraction of data hosted on distributed ledgers. Through high-level query abstractions, users connect to underlying blockchains, perform data requests, extract transactions, manage data assets and derive high-level analytic insights. Most importantly, due to the inherent interoperable nature of Datachain, queries and analytic jobs are reusable and can be executed without alterations on different underlying blockchains.

In this research work, we question this energy expenditure of PoW under blockchain use cases where some form of trust exists between the peers. We propose a Proof-of-Trust (PoT) blockchain where peer trust is valuated in the network based on a trust graph that emerges in a decentralized fashion and that is encoded in and managed by the blockchain itself.

More general, the composability of these constructs admitting the subtype relation powers the reusability, modular, flexibility and reliability of oo-based systems. While nominal classes allow annotation of user intention to the types, operations on interfaces and contracts naturally result structural constructs. Structural types are also necessary if we need the types to have value-semantics, so that they can be transferred around in distributed systems. Building a type system that allows the coexistence of nominal and structural classes, while maintaining the usual subtype relation is critical and challenging. We present a subtyping scheme that encodes a class to a directed and edge-labeled graph, which has the convenience to handle recursive types. The names of a class and its superclasses are encoded as tags to label the edges of the graph, turning the nominal construct into a structural one. This encoding allows us to unify the handling of class relations into graph relations. We define the class representation, canonical form, value-identity and subtype relation in the notion of graphs, and justify our subtyping scheme in the cases of multiple inheritance, class intersection and union.

Mosaic contains a network of vaults, one on each layer and chain, and we present our research into improving the operation and robustness of said bridge via liquidity forecasting of its associated vaults. Users utilize the bridge to transfer assets from a source network and source layer (a source vault) to a destination network and layer (a destination vault). However, if a vault is near depletion when a transfer is initiated the transfer can fail due to inefficient liquidity. Thus, critical to maximizing the user experience of Mosaic is being able to forecast accurately when the liquidity will be depleted from vaults supported by Mosaic. After introducing Mosaic, and without loss of generality, we forecast liquidity movements between three vaults: one on the layer 1 (L1) Ethereum mainnet, one on the L2 Polygon (POL) network, and one on the L2 Arbitrum (ARB) network. We demonstrate state of the art results from our statistical and AI methods that can consistently achieve low average errors (e.g., <2% liquidity) and high coverage (e.g., >80%) of the true liquidity levels in their 1-week-ahead forecast confidence intervals. As a baseline, we first develop autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting. The ARIMA models are optimized at each time step and provide conservative confidence intervals that allow us to safely assess the times when vaults will reach critical liquidity values and therefore, prevent depletion. To further enhance our forecasting framework, we also develop a machine learning approach with Gaussian Processes that can further capture time series trends, past replenishment events, where large discontinuities are present. Liquidity data for our forecasting methodologies will be provided in two levels of fidelity. We first introduce our in-house Liquidity Simulation Environment (LSE) - a state machine capable of running hypothetical vault liquidity scenarios under certain assumed cross-layer trades/swaps. Next, we forecast real-world data obtained from a recent PoC three-vault bridge setup run by Composable, and we apply the LSE to that.

Many smart contract applications rely on data that resides outside the blockchain. However, while traditional web applications can communicate with trustworthy data sources directly through the Internet, this is not possible for smart contracts because their execution must be deterministic. Bringing external data into the blockchain has been a topic of research since the first introduction of Ethereum. A system that can provide this data to smart contracts is called an oracle. The primary requirement in designing oracles is that the authenticity of the data must be publicly verifiable, which can be achieved through signatures. However, transmitting data to the blockchain and performing the verification is costly, especially if applications require data from multiple sources. In that case, current approaches would need to retrieve the data from each source separately. In this paper, we present the concept of MUlti-Source oraCLE (MUSCLE) for retrieving data from multiple sources, which we believe to be the first to focus on the multi-source scenario. We implement five variants of MUSCLE, each using a different signature or aggregate signature scheme and compare their performance with two oracles that are based on TLS-N, which represents the current state of the art.

To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs.

Efficient Deterministic Concurrency Control Under Practical Isolation Levels,Ziliang Lai,"The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","(Ziliang Lai) FROM (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong)","Deterministic databases are able to run transactions efficiently in a distributed setting with minimal coordination. Research has shown many benefits from having determinism, from more lightweight database replication, to no/cheaper distributed commit, to high throughput during live migration. Besides those known applications, permissioned blockchain can also be viewed as an application of the deterministic database with security added. A permissioned blockchain maintains a fully-replicated database, where each replica is synchronized by getting blocks of updates. Early permissioned blockchains run a consensus protocol (e.g., PBFT) to agree on the input and rely on the replicas to execute the transactions serially to uphold determinism. Fabric allows concurrent transaction executions but rely on running consensus to agree on the read-write-sets and broadcasting them, which incurs an excessive volume of network traffic. Deterministic concurrency control combines the best of both worlds. It enables solving consensus on the small input, and each replica is able to execute transactions independently with high concurrency. Although powerful, contemporary deterministic databases are still primitive because they support only one isolation level -- Serializable. Furthermore, many deterministic concurrency control schemes are overly pessimistic and cause many unnecessary transaction aborts. These factors motivate us to design DCC, a suite of better deterministic concurrency control schemes, not only for Serializable but also for practical isolation levels beyond Serializable.",Hong Kong,18 June 2021,0,238,https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3450580

SERENIoT: Distributed Network Security Policy Management and Enforcement for Smart Homes,"Corentin Thomasset,David Barrera","Polytechnique Montréal,Carleton Univeristy","(Corentin Thomasset) FROM (Polytechnique Montréal),(David Barrera) FROM (Carleton Univeristy)","Selectively allowing network traffic has emerged as a dominant approach for securing consumer IoT devices. However, determining what the allowed behavior of an IoT device should be remains an open challenge. Proposals to date have relied on manufacturers and trusted parties to provide allow lists of network traffic, but these proposals require manufacturer involvement or placing trust in an additional stakeholder. Alternatively, locally monitoring devices can allow building allow lists of observed behavior, but devices may not exhaust their functionality set during the observation period, and the behavior may change following a software update which requires re-training. This paper proposes a blockchain-based system for determining whether an IoT device is behaving like other devices of the same type. Our system, SERENIoT, overcomes the challenge of initially determining the correct behavior for a device. Nodes in the SERENIoT public blockchain submit summaries of the network behavior observed for connected IoT devices and build allow lists of behavior observed by the majority of nodes. Changes in behavior through software updates are automatically added to the allow list once the update is broadly deployed. Through a proof-of-concept implementation of SERENIoT on a small IoT network and a large-scale Amazon EC2 simulation, we evaluate the security, scalability, and performance of our system.",Canada,08 December 2020,1,304,https://doi.org/10.1145/3427228.3427235

Unlike in traditional systems, Bitcoin transactions are publicly and permanently recorded, and anyone can access the full history of the records. Despite using pseudonymous identities, an adversary can undermine users’ financial privacy and reveal their actual identities by using advanced heuristics and techniques to identify possible links between transactions, senders, receivers, and consumed services (e.g., online purchases). Hence, a multitude of approaches has been proposed to reduce financial transparency and enhance users’ anonymity.

In such networks, broadcast is known to be an inefficient operation in terms of message complexity and overhead. In addition to the impact on the system performance, inefficient or delayed block propagation may have severe consequences regarding security and fairness of the consensus layer. Therefore, we introduce Kadcast, a novel peer-to-peer protocol for block propagation in blockchain networks. Kadcast utilizes the well-known structured overlay topology of Kademlia to realize an efficient broadcast operation with tunable overhead. As our protocol is based on UDP, we incorporate forward error correction (FEC) to increase reliability while still maintaining its lightweight protocol architecture. To this end, we build a probabilistic model to analyze Kadcast's resilience to packet losses and node failures. Moreover, we evaluate Kadcast's block delivery performance, broadcast reliability, efficiency, and security based on advanced network simulations, which confirm the merits of the Kadcast protocol.",Germany,21 October 2019,16,458,https://doi.org/10.1145/3318041.3355469

In the original protocol, the distributor and user are both equipped with trusted hardware. The data are encrypted and decrypted by this trusted hardware, with a shared secret key. When decrypting the data, the user's hardware generates a proof and sends it to the distributor. This proof is used as the proof of distribution to show to the owner for payment. This prevents the collusion with the help of the trusted hardware. This protocol assumes that the user will not misbehave and always send the proof back to the distributor. To address this issue, the modified protocol uses blockchain as a public ledger for the user to publish acknowledgement of receiving encrypted data chunk, and for the distributor to publish the corresponding secret for decryption.

Indeed, many critical security vulnerabilities within smart contracts on Ethereum platform have caused huge financial losses to their users. In this work, we present ContractFuzzer, a novel fuzzer to test Ethereum smart contracts for security vulnerabilities. ContractFuzzer generates fuzzing inputs based on the ABI specifications of smart contracts, defines test oracles to detect security vulnerabilities, instruments the EVM to log smart contracts runtime behaviors, and analyzes these logs to report security vulnerabilities. Our fuzzing of 6991 smart contracts has flagged more than 459 vulnerabilities with high precision.

The study is relevant since there is need for building up more trust in blockchain. In the course of the research, the main trends of decentralized financial systems were identified and presented, including the problems related to decentralized financial systems and options for resolving them. The study is aimed at defining the problems and searching for ways to tackle them when regulating decentralized finances (DeFi) in order to ensure effective regulation on the part of the Central Bank and control risks. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, DeFi, in fact, has to be regulated so as to achieve its main decentralization goal. In addition, DeFi presents a potential possibility for developing a fairly new regulation method: the idea of “integrated regulation”. The paper considers various approaches to regulation, which can be integrated in the DeFi design. It can potentially lead to the decentralization of both finance and its regulation, which eventually expresses RegTech (Regulatory Technology), which is used by financial organizations for being able to meet the requirements of the regulator more easily. The study defines the problems that are encountered in the course of using DeFi and points out the possible ways for dealing with them, including a way for switching to blockchain independently so that the transaction is not charged in ETH for calculation on blockchain; reducing the complexity and costs of use and understanding of DeFi software by most users. A whole lot of risks that decentralized financial protocols are susceptible to is analyzed: vulnerabilities in the code security of smart contracts, their stacking and layout; oracle risk, which is subject to manipulation in the process of data transfer; the financial risk of high volatility, regulatory risk and crisis of the global economy due to the inability to predict in which way the Covid-19 pandemic is going to be resolved.",Russia,28 September 2022,0,7,https://doi.org/10.1145/3527049.3527080

If these risks are not addressed in a timely fashion, then they could threaten the adoption and success of this promising technology. This article deals with a specific class of attacks in connected vehicles, namely tampering attacks caused due to compromise of on-board sensors. Current centralized solutions that employ trusted infrastructure to protect against adversarial manipulation of information cannot validate the correctness of the shared data and do not scale well. To overcome these issues, decentralized protection mechanisms by means of blockchain technology have emerged as a promising research direction. However, current permission-less, linear blockchain-based solutions have low transaction performance and high computational cost, thereby making it difficult to adopt them for security in connected vehicles. In this article, we present TangleCV, a directed acyclic graph–based distributed ledger technique for connected vehicles to address data tampering threats in connected vehicular networks. We describe new validation steps, tip selection strategies, and cumulative weight definition for TangleCV that not only meets the timing constraints of the connected vehicular networks but also secures the network against threats due to tampering attacks. We describe how the reputation of the network is established in TangleCV using trust factors calculated on the basis of ability, integrity, and benevolence of the nodes in the network. We present numerical results that demonstrate that the average value of the time to first approval decreases by more than 70% as the network evolves from a low load to a high load in the case of the nearest neighbor strategy. We observe that more than 60% of the nodes are approved in a low-load network and this number increases to 80% in a high-load network for the nearest neighbor strategy. The standard deviation of error measurements for nodes experiencing tampering attack is around 60% higher as compared to nodes that do not experience such an attack.",USA,30 December 2020,1,189,https://doi.org/10.1145/3404500

We derive a model, explaining how risk assessment and intended usage drive the decision which tools to use.

Further, domain names are not fully controlled by users, meaning that they can easily be taken down by authorities and registrars. Due to this, there have been efforts to build a decentralized name service that gives greater control to domain owners. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a major example. Yet, no existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, particularly regarding security and misbehavior. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement study of ENS. Our findings suggest that ENS has shown growth during its four years' evolution. We identify several security issues, including traditional name system problems, as well as new issues introduced by the unique properties of ENS. We find that attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS names, a number of scam blockchain addresses and indexing of malicious websites. We further develop a new record persistence attack, to find that 22,716 .eth names (3.7% of all names) are vulnerable to name hijacking.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance For Distributed Ledgers Revisited,Yongge Wang,"UNC Charlotte, Charlotte","(Yongge Wang) FROM (UNC Charlotte, Charlotte)","The problem of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) has received a lot of attention in the last 30 years. Due to the popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains in recent years, several BFT protocols have been deployed in the large scale of Internet environment. We analyze several popular BFT protocols such as Capser FFG/CBC-FBC for Ethereum 2.0 and GRANDPA for Polkadot. Our analysis shows that the security models for these BFT protocols are slightly different from the models commonly accepted in the academic literature. For example, we show that, if the adversary has a full control of the message delivery order in the underlying network, then none of the BFT protocols for Ethereum blockchain 2.0 and Polkadot blockchain could achieve liveness even in a synchronized network. Though it is not clear whether a practical adversary could actually control and re-order the underlying message delivery system (at Internet scale) to mount these attacks, it raises an interesting question on security model gaps between academic BFT protocols and deployed BFT protocols in the Internet scale. With these analysis, this article proposes a Casper CBC-FBC style binary BFT protocol and shows its security in the traditional academic security model with complete asynchronous networks. For partial synchronous networks, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol BDLS based on the seminal DLS protocol and show that it is one of the most efficient practical BFT protocols at large scale networks in the traditional academic BFT security model. The implementation of BDLS is available at https://github.com/yonggewang/bdls. Finally, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol XP for complete asynchronous networks and show its security in the traditional academic BFT security model.",NC,09 September 2022,0,155,https://doi.org/10.1145/3538227
"Sleepminting, the brand new frontier of Non Fungible Tokens fraud","Barbara Guidi,Andrea Michienzi","Università di Pisa,University of Pisa","(Barbara Guidi) FROM (Università di Pisa),(Andrea Michienzi) FROM (University of Pisa)","Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are becoming a standard to represent unique and valuable items, such as a piece of art, a videogame item, or other digital or physical goods, and keep track of their provenance. Thanks to blockchain technology and the power of smart contracts, NFT holders have true ownership over them, because they are the only ones who can transfer them. However, through an attack called sleepminting, an attacker is able to impersonate another person, including an artist, and create NFTs on the artist’s behalf, while still maintaining its possession, leveraging bugs in the code of the smart contract that manages the NFTs. Therefore, the attacker can cheat concerning the provenance of an NFT and then sell the fake NFTs to unaware buyers. In this paper, we propose a study that sheds light on this phenomenon. In particular, we collect over 1.3 million events that are connected to sleepminting and analyse the events under multiple aspects. The study uncovers that, by using the sleepminting attack, some users are able to create fake NFTs of popular brands, and are able to mint them to famous personalities in the NFT field, such as well known artists and collectors.",Italy,07 September 2022,0,75,https://doi.org/10.1145/3524458.3547239

While there has been a broad variety of research on BFT consensus protocols over the last decades, those protocols were originally not intended to scale for a large number of nodes. Thus, the quest for scalable BFT consensus was initiated with the emerging research interest in DLT.

The proof length of the protocol is around two orders of magnitude shorter than the existing post-quantum proposal, and scales efficiently to large anonymity sets, unlike the existing proposal. Further, we provide the first full implementation of a post-quantum RingCT, demonstrating the practicality of our scheme. In particular, a typical transaction can be generated in a fraction of a second and verified in about 23 ms on a standard PC. Moreover, we show how our scheme can be extended to provide auditability, where a user can select a particular authority from a set of authorities to reveal her identity. The user also has the ability to select no auditing and all these auditing options may co-exist in the same environment. The key ingredients, introduced in this work, of MatRiCT are 1) the shortest to date scalable ring signature from standard lattice assumptions with no Gaussian sampling required, 2) a novel balance zero-knowledge proof and 3) a novel extractable commitment scheme from (module) lattices. We believe these ingredients to be of independent interest for other privacy-preserving applications such as secure e-voting. Despite allowing 64-bit precision for transaction amounts, our new balance proof, and thus our protocol, does not require a range proof on a wide range (such as 32- or 64-bit ranges), which has been a major obstacle against efficient lattice-based solutions. Further, we provide new formal definitions for RingCT-like protocols, where the real-world blockchain setting is captured more closely. The definitions are applicable in a generic setting, and thus are believed to contribute to the development of future confidential transaction protocols in general (not only in the lattice setting).",Australia,06 November 2019,36,"1,158",https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3354200

Users should be able to atomically exchange tokens and assets without depending on centralized intermediaries such as exchanges. Recent peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain swap protocols use hashlocks and timelocks to ensure that participants comply to the protocol. However, an expired timelock could lead to a violation of the all-or-nothing atomicity property. An honest participant who fails to execute a smart contract on time due to a crash failure, denial of service attacks or even network delays might end up losing assets. Although a crashed participant is the only participant who ends up worse off, current proposals are unsuitable for atomic cross-chain transactions in asynchronous environments where crash failures and network delays are the norm. In this paper, we present AC3WN, the first decentralized all-or-nothing atomic cross-chain commitment protocol. The redeem and refund events of the smart contracts that exchange assets are modeled as conflicting events. An open permissionless network of witnesses is used to guarantee that conflicting events could never simultaneously occur and either all smart contracts in an atomic cross-chain transaction are redeemed or all of them are refunded.",California,26 June 2020,8,240,https://doi.org/10.14778/3397230.3397231

However, we argue that the security of some distributed systems critically depends on the opposite goal of preventing the overrepresentation of any minority, a goal not previously formalized that leads us to an optimization objective known as maximin support. After providing a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of this objective, we propose a new efficient election rule that simultaneously achieves a) a constant-factor approximation guarantee for it, and b) the property of proportional justified representation (PJR) - one of the strongest forms of proportional representation. However, the most striking feature of the new rule is that one can verify in linear time that the winning committee satisfies the two aforementioned guarantees, even when the algorithm is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output. As a result, the rule can be adapted into a verifiable computing scheme. Moreover, its verification procedure easily admits parallel processing for further efficiency.",Switzerland,23 November 2021,5,75,https://doi.org/10.1145/3479722.3480988

A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the propagation latency of blocks through the underlying peer-to-peer network, which is typically constructed by means of random connectivity. Disseminating blocks fast improves not only the transaction throughput, but also the security of the system as it reduces the probability of forks. In this paper we present CougaR: a simple yet efficient, eclipse-resistant, decentralized protocol that substantially reduces the block dissemination time in blockchain networks. CougaR's key advantages stem from its link selection policy, which combines a network latency criterion with randomness to offer fast and reliable block dissemination to the entire network. Moreover, CougaR is eclipse-resistant by design, as nodes are protected from having all their links directly or indirectly imposed on them by others, which is the typical vulnerability exploited to deploy eclipse attacks. We rigorously evaluate CougaR by an extensive set of experiments, both against a wide spectrum of parameter settings, and in comparison to the current state of the art.",Greece,15 July 2022,0,46,https://doi.org/10.1145/3524860.3539805

Roughly, PCNs are networks where each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents funds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the endpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by relaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path contains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a transaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. In deployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users for privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when routing transactions, users typically first guess a path, then check if it supports the transaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate of transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give substantial improvements in transaction success rate at the expense of privacy. In this work, we ask whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off privacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose noise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of graph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate either in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get large gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy by sacrificing a little utility.",USA,12 June 2020,7,761,https://doi.org/10.1145/3392147

The advantage for users is that the funds are not in custody of a centralized external entity. However, these exchanges are prone to manipulative behavior. In this paper, we illustrate how wash trading activity can be identified on two of the first popular limit order book-based decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, IDEX and EtherDelta. We identify a lower bound of accounts and trading structures that meet the legal definitions of wash trading, discovering that they are responsible for a wash trading volume in equivalent of 159 million U.S. Dollars. While self-trades and two-account structures are predominant, complex forms also occur. We quantify these activities, finding that on both exchanges, more than 30% of all traded tokens have been subject to wash trading activity. On EtherDelta, 10% of the tokens have almost exclusively been wash traded. All data is made available for future research. Our findings underpin the need for countermeasures that are applicable in decentralized systems.",Germany,03 June 2021,3,679,https://doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3449824

This paper provides a comparison of the empirical performance calculations with these 4 algorithms with different input volumes of sequential data (where every next slice of information is dependent of previous one) to make it impossible for parallel computation. For the purpose of calculations, 4 totally different environments are used but with exact number of CPUs and approximately similar amount of memory (using only standard instances types) -- one personal computer from one side and 3 of the biggest public cloud providers from another -- Amazon AWS (t2.medium), Microsoft Azure (Standard D2s v3) and Google Cloud (n1-standard-2). The purpose of the research is to compare these environments in terms of additional compute calculations and additional storage space (volumes and prices) for the presented new security improvement of the Merkle-root calculation.

They serve as effective hedging tools and improve economic development, but conversely are complicated and subject to heavy regulation. Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) enables a distributed, trustworthy ledger that stores encrypted information. It could enable frictionless, transparent, financial derivative processing by creating an inherently trustworthy ecosystem that eliminates the need for transaction verification. This paper discusses how different DLT protocols could facilitate financial derivatives. We then present a protocol for facilitating financial derivatives using Stellar's DLT protocol. Assessing our protocol shows that it processes derivatives efficiently with complete transparency. Comparing our DLT based derivatives to traditional derivatives affirms our belief that DLT enables an increase in transparency and reduction of market friction. However, we also found that DLT based derivatives have increased security and counterparty risk. Overall, if the developer mitigates the risks associated with DLT, our protocol could enable a level 3 blockchain application to improve the financial derivatives ecosystem significantly.",MN,03 July 2020,0,69,https://doi.org/10.1145/3399871.3399904

Client puzzles have been proposed to mitigate DoS attacks by requiring a client to prove legitimate intentions. Since its introduction, there have been several constructions of client puzzles. Nevertheless, most of the existing client puzzles are interactive, where a server constructs a puzzle for a client request and asks the client to solve it before giving access to a resource. Additionally, most existing client puzzles do not provide desirable properties such as fairness, non-parallelizability, or non-interactivity. In this work, we propose a non-interactive client puzzle that achieves all these desired properties through a verifiable delay function (VDF). In a non-interactive puzzle, the client generates a puzzle and sends its solution along with the puzzle to access a resource of the server. We present different methods to generate verifiable client puzzles to prevent puzzle forgery and attacks from the client side. Further, we exhibit a transformation of the client puzzle into a DoS-resistant protocol.

Intersecting Imaginaries: Visions of Decentralized Autonomous Systems,Caitlin (Caitie) Lustig,"University of Washington, Seattle, WA","(Caitlin (Caitie) Lustig) FROM (University of Washington, Seattle, WA)","Sociotechnical imaginaries are futures that people envision might be possible and desirable. They have a real impact on how systems are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.",USA,07 November 2019,13,905,https://doi.org/10.1145/3359312

The existing phishing scams detection technology on Ethereum mostly uses traditional machine learning or network representation learning to mine the key information from the transaction network to identify phishing addresses. However, these methods adopt the last transaction record or even completely ignore these records, and only manual-designed features are taken for the node representation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Transaction Aggregation Graph Network (TTAGN) to enhance phishing scams detection performance on Ethereum. Specifically, in the temporal edges representation module, we model the temporal relationship of historical transaction records between nodes to construct the edge representation of the Ethereum transaction network. Moreover, the edge representations around the node are aggregated to fuse topological interactive relationships into its representation, also named as trading features, in the edge2node module. We further combine trading features with common statistical and structural features obtained by graph neural networks to identify phishing addresses. Evaluated on real-world Ethereum phishing scams datasets, our TTAGN (92.8% AUC, and 81.6% F1-score) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and the effectiveness of temporal edges representation and edge2node module is also demonstrated.",China,25 April 2022,0,547,https://doi.org/10.1145/3485447.3512226

Obsidian is a new typestate-oriented programming language that uses a strong type system to rule out some of these vulnerabilities. Although Obsidian was designed to promote usability to make it as easy as possible to write programs, strong type systems can cause a language to be difficult to use. In particular, ownership, typestate, and assets, which Obsidian uses to provide safety guarantees, have not seen broad adoption together in popular languages and result in significant usability challenges. We performed an empirical study with 20 participants comparing Obsidian to Solidity, which is the language most commonly used for writing smart contracts today. We observed that Obsidian participants were able to successfully complete more of the programming tasks than the Solidity participants. We also found that the Solidity participants commonly inserted asset-related bugs, which Obsidian detects at compile time.",USA,13 November 2020,5,783,https://doi.org/10.1145/3428200

In this new model, referred to as the append memory model, nodes are allowed to write new values to the unordered memory, but not to overwrite already existing values. We show that although this model differs from the standard shared memory model with n shared read-write registers, many known results from the shared memory model still hold in the append memory model: It is, for example, impossible to establish consensus on n nodes with one crash failure if the nodes in the system are asynchronous. We also consider the append memory model in a synchronous setting with Byzantine failures. For this case, we show that Byzantine agreement cannot be solved in less than t+1 rounds, where t is the number of Byzantine nodes in the system. Assuming a probabilistic access restriction to the append memory, we compare the Byzantine agreement protocols on the Chain and the DAG. We show that the DAG structure achieves an almost optimal resilience (close to t<n/2) in contrast to the Chain structure that can tolerate less than t<n/(1+l*(n-t)) Byzantine nodes, where l is the rate at which the nodes access the memory.",Switzerland,09 July 2020,1,102,https://doi.org/10.1145/3350755.3400272
Clock Design Methodology for Energy and Computation Efficient Bitcoin Mining Machines,"Chienpang Lu,Iris Hui-Ru Jiang,Chihwen Yang","Independent, Zhubei,National Taiwan University, Taipei,DigWise Technology ltd., Zhubei","(Chienpang Lu) FROM (Independent, Zhubei),(Iris Hui-Ru Jiang) FROM (National Taiwan University, Taipei),(Chihwen Yang) FROM (DigWise Technology ltd., Zhubei)","Bitcoin mining machines become a new driving force to push the physical limitation of semiconductor process technology. Instead of peak performance, mining machines pursue energy and computation efficiency of implementing cryptographic hash functions. Therefore, the state-of-the-art ASIC design of mining machines adopts near-threshold computing, deep pipelines, and uni-directional data flow. According to these design properties, in this paper, we propose a novel clock reversing tree design methodology for bitcoin mining machines. In the clock reversing tree, the clock of global tree is fed from the last pipeline stage backward to the first one, and the clock latency difference between the local clock roots of two consecutive stages maintains a constant delay. The local tree of each stage is well balanced and keeps the same clock latency. The special clock topology naturally utilizes setup time slacks to gain hold time margins. Moreover, to alleviate the incurred on-chip variations due to near-threshold computing, we maximize the common clock path shared by flip-flops of each individual stage. Finally, we perform inverter pair swap to maintain duty cycle. Experimental results show that our methodology is promising for industrial bitcoin mining designs: Compared with two variation-aware clock network synthesis approaches widely used in modern ASIC designs, our approach can reduce up to 64% clock buffer/inverter usage, 12% clock power, decrease 99% hold time violating paths, and achieve 85% area saving for timing fixing.

A key challenge with smart contracts is ensuring their correctness and security. Several test input generation techniques for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts have been proposed in the last few years. However, a comparison of proposed techniques to gauge their effectiveness is missing. Aim: This paper conducts an empirical evaluation of testing techniques for smart contracts. The testing techniques we evaluated are: (1) Blackbox fuzzing, (2) Adaptive fuzzing, (3) Coverage-guided fuzzing with an SMT solver and (4) Genetic algorithm. We do not consider static analysis tools, as several recent studies have assessed and compared effectiveness of these tools. Method: We evaluate effectiveness of the test generation techniques using (1) Coverage achieved - we use four code coverage metrics targeting smart contracts, (2) Fault finding ability - using artificially seeded and real security vulnerabilities of different types. We used two datasets in our evaluation - one with 1665 real smart contracts from Etherscan, and another with 90 real contracts with known vulnerabilities to assess fault finding ability. Result: We find Adaptive fuzzing performs best in terms of coverage and fault finding over contracts in both datasets. Conclusion: However, we believe considering dependencies between functions and handling Solidity specific features will help improve the performance of all techniques considerably.",United Kingdom,11 October 2021,0,245,https://doi.org/10.1145/3475716.3475779

The potential that these data may be exploited poses a rising concern over how privacy is protected by these social network platforms.

This situation begs the question: How to properly compensate social network users for the disclosure of their data hosted in the network while preserving their privacy? In this paper, we consider data trade between a large amount of privacy-aware social network users, and a data broker with a budget who wants to find out aggregate friendship information of this social network. We propose an incentive mechanism for pricing social network data and privacy preservation. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies many desirable properties, including incentive compatibility, individual rationality, budget balance, and node differential privacy.

In addition, their widespread industrial applications and the continuous introduction of cryptocurrencies are also stimulating the attention of the public opinion. The underlying structure of these technologies constitutes one of their core concepts. In particular, they are based on peer-to-peer networks. Accordingly, all nodes lie at the same level, so that there is no place for privileged actors as, for instance, banking institutions in classical financial networks. In this work, we perform a preliminary investigation on two kinds of network, i.e. the Bitcoin network and the Bitcoin Cash network. Notably, we analyze their global structure and we try to evaluate if they are provided with a small-world behavior. Results suggest that the principle known as 'fittest-gets-richer', combined with a continuous increasing of connections, might constitute the mechanism leading these networks to reach their current structure.

SAMPL: Scalable Auditability of Monitoring Processes using Public Ledgers,,"New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM,New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM,New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM,New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM",,"Organized surveillance, especially by governments poses a major challenge to individual privacy, due to the resources governments have at their disposal, and the possibility of overreach. Given the impact of invasive monitoring, in most democratic countries, government surveillance is, in theory, monitored and subject to public oversight to guard against violations. In practice, there is a difficult fine balance between safeguarding individual's privacy rights and not diluting the efficacy of national security investigations, as exemplified by reports on government surveillance programs that have caused public controversy, and have been challenged by civil and privacy rights organizations. Surveillance is generally conducted through a mechanism where federal agencies obtain a warrant from a federal or state judge (e.g., the US FISA court, Supreme Court in Canada) to subpoena a company or service-provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft) for their customers' data. The courts provide annual statistics on the requests (accepted, rejected), while the companies provide annual transparency reports for public auditing. However, in practice, the statistical information provided by the courts and companies is at a very high level, generic, is released after-the-fact, and is inadequate for auditing the operations. Often this is attributed to the lack of scalable mechanisms for reporting and transparent auditing. In this paper, we present SAMPL, a novel auditing framework which leverages cryptographic mechanisms, such as zero knowledge proofs, Pedersen commitments, Merkle trees, and public ledgers to create a scalable mechanism for auditing electronic surveillance processes involving multiple actors. SAMPL is the first framework that can identify the actors (e.g., agencies and companies) that violate the purview of the court orders. We experimentally demonstrate the scalability for SAMPL for handling concurrent monitoring processes without undermining their secrecy and auditability.",USA,06 November 2019,3,695,https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3354219

However, existing WiFi-based approaches have not been ready for real-world deployment due to the limited scalability, especially for unseen gestures. The reason behind is that when introducing unseen gestures, prior works have to collect a large number of samples and re-train the model. While the recent advance of few-shot learning has brought new opportunities to solve this problem, the overhead has not been effectively reduced. This is because these methods still require enormous data to learn adequate prior knowledge, and their complicated training process intensifies the regular training cost. In this paper, we propose a WiFi-based HGR system, namely OneFi, which can recognize unseen gestures with only one (or few) labeled samples. OneFi fundamentally addresses the challenge of high overhead. On the one hand, OneFi utilizes a virtual gesture generation mechanism such that the massive efforts in prior works can be significantly alleviated in the data collection process. On the other hand, OneFi employs a lightweight one-shot learning framework based on transductive fine-tuning to eliminate model re-training. We additionally design a self-attention based backbone, termed as WiFi Transformer, to minimize the training cost of the proposed framework. We establish a real-world testbed using commodity WiFi devices and perform extensive experiments over it. The evaluation results show that OneFi can recognize unseen gestures with the accuracy of 84.2, 94.2, 95.8, and 98.8% when 1, 3, 5, 7 labeled samples are available, respectively, while the overall training process takes less than two minutes.",China,15 November 2021,2,849,https://doi.org/10.1145/3485730.3485936

Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections.

Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections.

Second, the generated control flow graph is analyzed to obtain the variable information in the Solidity programs, locate the require statements, and also get the definition-use pairs to be tested. Finally, a genetic algorithm is used to generate test cases, in which an improved fitness function is proposed to calculate the definition-use pairs coverage of each test case with program instrumentation.

A publicly-known function scores each credential in a manner so that the distribution of the lowest scoring credential is identical to the distribution of stake owned by each account. The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring credential is the leader for round r, and their credential becomes the seed Qr+1. Such protocols leave open the possibility of manipulation: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring credentials in round r can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in order to influence the seed for round r+1.

Decomposing the fault thresholds in this way allows us to design protocols that provide meaningful fault tolerance under both synchrony and asynchrony (or partial synchrony). We establish tight fault thresholds bounds for multi-threshold BFT and present protocols achieving them. As an example, we show a BFT state machine replication (SMR) protocol that tolerates up to 2n/3 faults for safety under synchrony while tolerating up to n/3 faults for other scenarios (liveness under synchrony as well as safety and liveness under partial synchrony). This is strictly stronger than classic partially synchronous SMR protocols. We also present a general framework to transform known partially synchronous or asynchronous BFT SMR protocols to additionally enjoy the optimal 2n/3 fault tolerance for safety under synchrony.",USA,13 November 2021,3,407,https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484554
"Is Cryptocurrency Money?: Three Empirical Studies Analyzing Medium of Exchange, Store of Value and Unit of Account","Jens Mattke,Christian Maier,Lea Reis","University of Bamberg, Bamberg,University of Bamberg, Bamberg,University of Bamberg, Bamberg","(Jens Mattke) FROM (University of Bamberg, Bamberg),(Christian Maier) FROM (University of Bamberg, Bamberg),(Lea Reis) FROM (University of Bamberg, Bamberg)","Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Ripple, are discussed as a new form of money. Typically, money fulfills three core functions: 1) medium of exchange, 2) store of value, and 3) unit of account. To examine whether individuals consider cryptocurrencies as money, we conduct three studies. Study 1 (N=57) provides valid and reliable measurement items for the three core functions of money. Study 2 (N=95) shows that the general perception about the fulfillment of the core functions is rather positive for cryptocurrencies. The results from Study 3 (N=99) furthermore reveal that Bitcoin is perceived significantly better in fulfilling all three functions than Ethereum or Ripple. The findings suggest that cryptocurrency research needs to include or at least control for the basic perceptions of core functions when examining individuals' adoption or use of cryptocurrency as money. Furthermore, the findings suggest that existing knowledge from Bitcoin use or adoption research cannot be easily transferred to the context of another cryptocurrency.",Germany,19 June 2020,10,"1,274",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393859

Utilising the data emerging from such networks is an essential step for developing sustainable future energy systems, as such systems must be closely monitored and managed to avoid blackouts and failures. The datasets within energy systems are very large, must be immutable, are often interrelated, yet owned by competing organisations. How then should these datasets be stored and shared? This is the main focus of my research. To provide a reliable way of collecting, storing, sharing, and analysing energy systems data, I propose to use the newly emerging distributed ledger technology. I will work towards developing a middleware-like platform over distributed ledgers, which would aim to provide a reliable data storage solution for immutable energy datasets, while also maintaining relationships between the datasets and addressing the read and write latency and scalability problems of the present distributed ledgers.",Bristol,31 July 2020,0,25,https://doi.org/10.1145/3401335.3401356

Depending on whether or not the message is required, we could divide two-party signing into two different phases, namely, offline and online. Ideally, the online phase should be made as lightweight as possible. At the same time, the cost of the offline phase should remain similar to that of a normal signature generation. However, the existing two-party protocols of ECDSA are not optimal: either their online phase requires decryption of a ciphertext, or their offline phase needs at least two executions of multiplicative-to-additive conversion which dominates the overall complexity. This paper proposes an online-friendly two-party ECDSA with a lightweight online phase and a single multiplicative-to-additive function in the offline phase. It is constructed by a novel design of a re-sharing of the secret key and a linear sharing of the nonce. Our scheme significantly improves previous protocols based on either oblivious transfer or homomorphic encryption. We implement our scheme and show that it outperforms prior online-friendly schemes (i.e., those have lightweight online cost) by a factor of roughly 2 to 9 in both communication and computation.

As a result, using our ADKG we remove the trusted setup assumption that the most scalable consensus algorithms make. In order to create a DKG with a dual (f,2f+1)- threshold we first answer in the affirmative the open question posed by Cachin et al. [7] on how to create an Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing (AVSS) protocol with a reconstruction threshold of f+1<k łe 2f+1, which is of independent interest. Our High-threshold-AVSS (HAVSS) uses an asymmetric bivariate polynomial to encode the secret. This enables the reconstruction of the secret only if a set of k nodes contribute while allowing an honest node that did not participate in the sharing phase to recover his share with the help of f+1 honest parties. Once we have HAVSS we can use it to bootstrap scalable partially synchronous consensus protocols, but the question on how to get a DKG in asynchrony remains as we need a way to produce common randomness. The solution comes from a novelEventually Perfect Common Coin (EPCC) abstraction that enables the generation of a common coin from n concurrent HAVSS invocations. EPCC's key property is that it is eventually reliable, as it might fail to agree at most f times (even if invoked a polynomial number of times). UsingEPCC we implement anEventually Efficient Asynchronous Binary Agreement (EEABA) which is optimal when the EPCC agrees and protects safety when EPCC fails. Finally, using EEABA we construct the first ADKG which has the same overhead and expected runtime as the best partially-synchronous DKG (O(n4) words, O(f) rounds).

"Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation for Computationally-Secure Randomness, Consensus, and Threshold Signatures.","Eleftherios Kokoris-Kogias,Dahlia Malkhi,Alexander Spiegelman","Facebook Novi & IST Austria, London,Facebook Novi, Menlo Park, CA,Facebook Novi, Menlo Park, CA","(Eleftherios Kokoris-Kogias) FROM (Facebook Novi & IST Austria, London),(Dahlia Malkhi) FROM (Facebook Novi, Menlo Park, CA),(Alexander Spiegelman) FROM (Facebook Novi, Menlo Park, CA)","In this paper, we present the first Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation (ADKG) algorithm which is also the first distributed key generation algorithm that can generate cryptographic keys with a dual (f,2f+1)-threshold (where f is the number of faulty parties). As a result, using our ADKG we remove the trusted setup assumption that the most scalable consensus algorithms make. In order to create a DKG with a dual (f,2f+1)- threshold we first answer in the affirmative the open question posed by Cachin et al. [7] on how to create an Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing (AVSS) protocol with a reconstruction threshold of f+1<k łe 2f+1, which is of independent interest. Our High-threshold-AVSS (HAVSS) uses an asymmetric bivariate polynomial to encode the secret. This enables the reconstruction of the secret only if a set of k nodes contribute while allowing an honest node that did not participate in the sharing phase to recover his share with the help of f+1 honest parties. Once we have HAVSS we can use it to bootstrap scalable partially synchronous consensus protocols, but the question on how to get a DKG in asynchrony remains as we need a way to produce common randomness. The solution comes from a novelEventually Perfect Common Coin (EPCC) abstraction that enables the generation of a common coin from n concurrent HAVSS invocations. EPCC's key property is that it is eventually reliable, as it might fail to agree at most f times (even if invoked a polynomial number of times). UsingEPCC we implement anEventually Efficient Asynchronous Binary Agreement (EEABA) which is optimal when the EPCC agrees and protects safety when EPCC fails. Finally, using EEABA we construct the first ADKG which has the same overhead and expected runtime as the best partially-synchronous DKG (O(n4) words, O(f) rounds). As a corollary of our ADKG, we can also create the first Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement (VABA) that does not need a trusted dealer to setup threshold signatures of degree n-f.

A Chaincode-based Framework for Securing Patient Health Information in Hospital Environment,"Anitha Premkumar,Shanmugarathinam","CSE, Presidency University,CSE, Presidency University","(Anitha Premkumar) FROM (CSE, Presidency University),(Shanmugarathinam) FROM (CSE, Presidency University)","Goal of any healthcare system is to provide good service to the public in a most effective manner. The hospital healthcare system is a common platform for people to access the health related services, anytime and anywhere. This service is completely driven by the regulations and policies of government and hospital administration. At present most hospital systems in India lack a secure mechanism for maintaining and managing patient health records. This is a crucial capability which a hospital healthcare system must have. Failure to have a robust system will cause multiple issues like inaccessibility when required, wrongfully sharing patient health record or allowing unethical players to access the health records. This will ultimately lead to lack of trust in the system Most of the current hospital healthcare systems store information centrally and provide access to the connected nodes as required. This architecture leads to single point of failure when central server is down or crashes or gets hacked. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a Chaincode-based framework to secure patient health information in hospital environment. Chaincode is a smart contract program which gets executed on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network automatically. A Chaincode stores the information in decentralized digital ledger and creates a secured and private blockchain network with trusted nodes and provide data visibility, data security, and data transparency with respect to patient health record at any time. This technology could solve the above said problem in more efficient way and provide better visibility and transparency to patient health data with more security.",India,28 March 2022,0,36,https://doi.org/10.1145/3512676.3512681

In particular, smart contracts running on Ethereum (i.e., one of the most popular blockchain platforms) are often developed with Solidity, and their deployment and execution consume gas (i.e., a fee compensating the computing resources required). Smart contract development frequently involves code reuse, but poor readable smart contracts could hinder their reuse. However, writing readable smart contracts is challenging, since practices for improving the readability could also be in contrast with optimization strategies for reducing gas consumption. This paper aims at better understanding (i) the readability aspects for which traditional software and smart contracts differ, and (ii) the specific smart contract readability features exhibiting significant relationships with gas consumption. We leverage a set of metrics that previous research has proven correlated with code readability. In particular, we first compare the values of these metrics obtained for both Solidity smart contracts and traditional software systems (written in Java). Then, we investigate the correlations occurring between these metrics and gas consumption and between each pair of metrics. The results of our study highlight that smart contracts usually exhibit lower readability than traditional software for what concerns the number of parentheses, inline comments, and blank lines used. In addition, we found some readability metrics (such as the average length of identifiers and the average number of keywords) that significantly correlate with gas consumption.",Italy,20 October 2022,0,5,https://doi.org/10.1145/3524610.3529157

A fair exchange protocol allows a sender S to sell a digital commodity x for a fixed price p to a receiver R. The protocol is said to be secure if R only pays if he receives the correct x. Our solution guarantees fairness by relying on smart contracts executed over decentralized cryptocurrencies, where the contract takes the role of an external judge that completes the exchange in case of disagreement. While in the past there have been several proposals for building fair exchange protocols over cryptocurrencies, our solution has two distinctive features that makes it particular attractive when users deal with large commodities. These advantages are: (1) minimizing the cost for running the smart contract on the blockchain, and (2) avoiding expensive cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs.

FairSwap: How To Fairly Exchange Digital Goods,"Stefan Dziembowski,Lisa Eckey,Sebastian Faust","University of Warsaw, Warsaw,TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt,TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt","(Stefan Dziembowski) FROM (University of Warsaw, Warsaw),(Lisa Eckey) FROM (TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt),(Sebastian Faust) FROM (TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt)","We introduce FairSwap -- an efficient protocol for fair exchange of digital goods using smart contracts. A fair exchange protocol allows a sender S to sell a digital commodity x for a fixed price p to a receiver R. The protocol is said to be secure if R only pays if he receives the correct x. Our solution guarantees fairness by relying on smart contracts executed over decentralized cryptocurrencies, where the contract takes the role of an external judge that completes the exchange in case of disagreement. While in the past there have been several proposals for building fair exchange protocols over cryptocurrencies, our solution has two distinctive features that makes it particular attractive when users deal with large commodities. These advantages are: (1) minimizing the cost for running the smart contract on the blockchain, and (2) avoiding expensive cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to our new protocols, we provide formal security definitions for smart contract based fair exchange, and prove security of our construction.

Transaction Fee Mechanism Design,Tim Avelin Roughgarden,"Columbia University, New York, NY","(Tim Avelin Roughgarden) FROM (Columbia University, New York, NY)","Demand for blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is far larger than supply, necessitating a mechanism that selects a subset of transactions to include ""on-chain"" from the pool of all pending transactions. EIP-1559 is a proposal to make several tightly coupled changes to the Ethereum blockchain's transaction fee mechanism, including the introduction of variable-size blocks and a burned base fee that rises and falls with demand. These changes are slated for deployment in Ethereum's ""London fork,"" scheduled for late summer 2021, at which point it will be the biggest economic change made to a major blockchain to date. The first goal of this paper is to formalize the problem of designing a transaction fee mechanism, taking into account the many idiosyncrasies of the blockchain setting (ranging from off-chain collusion between miners and users to the ease of money-burning). The second goal is to situate the specific mechanism proposed in EIP-1559 in this framework and rigorously interrogate its game-theoretic properties.

The Gap Game,"Itay Tsabary,Ittay Eyal","Technion, Haifa,Technion, Haifa","(Itay Tsabary) FROM (Technion, Haifa),(Ittay Eyal) FROM (Technion, Haifa)","Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized consensus protocol by incentives. The protocol participants, called miners, generate (mine) a series of blocks, each containing monetary transactions created by system users. As incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted currency and transaction fees paid by transaction creators. Blockchain bandwidth limits lead users to pay increasing fees in order to prioritize their transactions. However, most prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a notable exception, Carlsten et al. [17] postulated that if incentives come only from fees then a mining gap would form~--- miners would avoid mining when the available fees are insufficient. In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings, taking into account all elements of expenses and rewards. To study when gaps form, we analyze the system as a game we call the gap game. We analyze the game with a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a wide range of scenarios. Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.'s postulate; indeed, we show that gaps form well before fees are the only incentive, and analyze the implications on security. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different gap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operating costs are identical. Alarmingly, we see that the system incentivizes large miner coalitions, reducing system decentralization. We describe the required conditions to avoid the incentive misalignment, providing guidelines for future cryptocurrency design.",Israel,15 October 2018,36,"1,339",https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243737

To answer these questions, we embark on an axiomatic theory of incentives in proof-of-work blockchains at the time scale of a single block. We consider desirable properties of allocation rules including: symmetry; budget balance (weak or strong); sybil-proofness; and various grades of collusion-proofness. We show that Bitcoin's proportional allocation rule is the unique allocation rule satisfying a certain system of properties, but this does not hold for slightly weaker sets of properties, or when the miners are not risk-neutral.

However, formal barriers to ""getting the incentives right"" were recently discovered, driven by the desire to use the blockchain itself as a source of pseudorandomness. We consider instead a longest-chain Proof-of-Stake protocol with perfect, trusted, external randomness (e.g. a randomness beacon). We produce two main results. First, we show that a strategic miner can strictly outperform an honest miner with just 32.8% of the total stake. Note that a miner of this size cannot outperform an honest miner in the Proof-of-Work model. This establishes that even with access to a perfect randomness beacon, incentives in Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake longest-chain protocols are fundamentally different. Second, we prove that a strategic miner cannot outperform an honest miner with 30.8% of the total stake. This means that, while not quite as secure as the Proof-of-Work regime, desirable incentive properties of Proof-of-Work longest-chain protocols can be approximately recovered via Proof-of-Stake with a perfect randomness beacon. The space of possible strategies in a Proof-of-Stake mining game is significantly richer than in a Proof-of-Work game.

It employs a trust-jointed reputation scheme to balance the weights between trust values of parameters and bid prices. The latter is responsible for initiating FL auction tasks, calculating price rankings, and assigning corresponding token rewards.

After that, the attackers' strategy has been further discussed by many other works, which analyze the strategy and behavior of a single attacker.

The attackers can be independent of others instead of sharing information and attacking the blockchain as a whole. In this paper, we will establish a new model to analyze the miners' behavior in a proof of work blockchain with multiple attackers.

Uncovering Smart Contract VM Bugs Via Differential Fuzzing,"Dominik Maier,Fabian Fäßler,Jean Pierre Seifert","Technische Universität Berlin,Technische Universität Berlin,Technische Universität Berlin","(Dominik Maier) FROM (Technische Universität Berlin),(Fabian Fäßler) FROM (Technische Universität Berlin),(Jean Pierre Seifert) FROM (Technische Universität Berlin)","The ongoing public interest in blockchains and smart contracts has brought a rise to a magnitude of different blockchain implementations. The rate at which new concepts are envisioned and implemented makes it hard to vet their impact on security. Especially smart contract platforms, executing untrusted code, are very complex by design. Still, people put their trust and money into chains that may lack proper testing. A behavior deviation for edge cases of single op-codes is a critical bug class in this brave new world. It can be abused for Denial of Service against the blockchain, chain splits, double-spending, or direct attacks on applications operating on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose an automated methodology to uncover such differences. Through coverage-guided and state-guided fuzzing, we explore smart contract virtual machine behavior against multiple VMs in parallel. We develop NeoDiff, the first framework for feedback-guided differential fuzzing of smart contract VMs. We discuss real, monetary consequences our tool prevents. NeoDiff can be ported to new smart contract platforms with ease. Apart from fuzzing Ethereum VMs, NeoDiff found a range of critical differentials in VMs for the Neo blockchain. Moreover, through a higher-layer semantics mutator, we uncovered semantic discrepancies between Neo smart contracts written in Python when executed on the blockchain vs. classic CPython. Along the way, NeoDiff uncovered memory corruptions in the C# Neo VM.",Germany,27 January 2022,0,50,https://doi.org/10.1145/3503921.3503923
Comparative Analysis Using Supervised Learning Methods for Anti-Money Laundering in Bitcoin,"Ismail Alarab,Simant Prakoonwit,Mohamed Ikbal Nacer","Bournemouth University,Bournemouth University,Bournemouth University","(Ismail Alarab) FROM (Bournemouth University),(Simant Prakoonwit) FROM (Bournemouth University),(Mohamed Ikbal Nacer) FROM (Bournemouth University)","With the advance of Bitcoin technology, money laundering has been incentivised as a den of Bitcoin blockchain, in which the user's identity is hidden behind a pseudonym known as address. Although this trait permits concealing in the plain sight, the public ledger of Bitcoin blockchain provides more power for investigators and allows collective intelligence for anti-money laundering and forensic analysis. This fascinating paradox arises in the strength of Bitcoin technology. Machine learning techniques have attained promising results in forensic analysis, in order to spot suspicious behaviour in Bitcoin blockchain. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of classical supervised learning methods using a recently published data set derived from Bitcoin blockchain, to predict licit and illicit transactions in the network. Besides, an ensemble learning method is utilised using a combination of the given supervised learning models, which outperforms the given classical methods. This experiment is performed using a newly published data set derived from Bitcoin blockchain. Our main contribution points out that using ensemble learning approach outperforms the performance of the classical learning models used in the original paper, using Elliptic data set, a time series of Bitcoin transaction graph with node transactions and directed payments flow edges. Using the same data set, we show that we are able to predict licit/illicit transactions with an accuracy of 98.13% and F1 score equals to 83.36% using the proposed method.

Specifically, secret sharing enables hiding the outsourced encrypted data from any unauthorized entity, and verifiable computing enable resource-constraint users to access the database in which the correctness is undoubtedly confirmed. This paper also compares the database scheme based on blockchain and the proposed method in terms of performance. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme entirely based on the conventional Internet computes the operations lighter than the blockchain scheme.",JAPAN,26 November 2021,0,24,https://doi.org/10.1145/3481646.3481650

Study on Health Behavior Pattern of Community Residents in Public Health Emergency,"Shugang Li,Qian Dou","School of Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai,School of Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai","(Shugang Li) FROM (School of Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai),(Qian Dou) FROM (School of Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai)","The psychological reaction and behavior mechanism of people in public health emergency is complex and difficult to observe. Combined with the stimulation of different supervision mechanisms of blockchain and different levels of human needs, this study constructs an influencing factors analysis model of residents' health behavior, analyzes the impact of different supervision environment stimuli on residents' health behavior, and excavates the mechanism of residents' health behavior, so as to provide reference for epidemic prevention and control departments. The empirical analysis shows that residents' risk perception and sense of belonging are significantly affected by three supervisory stimuli: health certification, behavioral civilization points and subjective norm. In addition, risk perception and sense of belonging also have effect on residents' compulsory health behavior and self-conscious health behavior, thus clarifying the mechanism of residents' health behavior patterns under the blockchain environment.",China,17 December 2021,0,18,https://doi.org/10.1145/3477282.3477295
On The Unforkability of Monero,"Dimaz Ankaa Wijaya,Joseph K Liu,Ron Steinfeld,Dongxi Liu,Jiangshan Yu","Monash University, Clayton,Monash University, Clayton,Monash University, Clayton,Data61, CSIRO, Clayton,Monash University, Clayton","(Dimaz Ankaa Wijaya) FROM (Monash University, Clayton),(Joseph K Liu) FROM (Monash University, Clayton),(Ron Steinfeld) FROM (Monash University, Clayton),(Dongxi Liu) FROM (Data61, CSIRO, Clayton),(Jiangshan Yu) FROM (Monash University, Clayton)","Monero, ranked as one of the top privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies by market cap, introduced semi-annual hard fork in 2018. Although hard fork is not an uncommon event in the cryptocurrency industry, the two hard forks in 2018 caused an anonymity risk to Monero where transactions became traceable due to the problem of key reuse. Thisproblem was triggered by the existence of multiple copies of the same coin on different Monero blockchain branches such that the users spent the coins multiple times without preemptive action. We investigate the Monero hard fork events by analysing the transaction data on three different branches of the Monero blockchain. Although we have discovered an insignificant portion of traceable inputs compared to the total available inputs in our dataset, our analyses show that the scalability of the event depends on external factors such as market price and market availability. We propose a cheap, easy to implement strategy to prevent the problem of key reuse, should in the future stronger Monero forks emerge in the market.",Australia,02 July 2019,5,352,https://doi.org/10.1145/3321705.3329823
SocialFi: towards the new shape of social media,"Barbara Guidi,Andrea Michienzi","University of Pisa,University of Pisa","(Barbara Guidi) FROM (University of Pisa),(Andrea Michienzi) FROM (University of Pisa)","Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is considered a new vision of banking and financial services based on Peer-to-Peer technology, and in particular on the blockchain technology. Since 2020, DeFi has started to develop in the cryptocurrency markets. Then, with the increase in popularity of digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and with the launch of the Metaverse, DeFi has been introduced into the Social environment by the combination of social networking and finance in the blockchain. This new shape of DeFi has been called Social Finance (SocialFi). SocialFi can be seen as the social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing to get monetary benefits from being part of SocialFi platforms. In detail, SocialFi has a special feature that is decentralized, open and user-controlled, and it started to be adopted by the communities. The main component of SocialFi is the Social token used to reward people. In this paper, we describe in detail the concept of SocialFi, and we discuss its application on future Social Media platforms.",Italy,25 July 2022,0,72,https://doi.org/10.1145/3545196.3545201

The core concept of this system is an open and anonymous network of nodes, or miners, which together maintain a public ledger of transactions. The ledger takes the form of a chain of blocks, the blockchain, where each block is a batch of new transactions collected from users. One primary problem with Satoshi's blockchain is its highly limited scalability. The security of Satoshi's longest chain rule, more generally known as the Bitcoin protocol, requires that all honest nodes be aware of each other's blocks very soon after the block's creation. To this end, the throughput of the system is artificially suppressed so that each block fully propagates before the next one is created, and that very few ""orphan blocks"" that fork the chain be created spontaneously.",Israel,23 November 2021,2,131,https://doi.org/10.1145/3479722.3480990
How are solidity smart contracts tested in open source projects?: an exploratory study,"Luisa Palechor,Cor Paul Bezemer","University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB,University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB","(Luisa Palechor) FROM (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB),(Cor Paul Bezemer) FROM (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB)","Smart contracts are self-executing programs that are stored on the blockchain. Once a smart contract is compiled and deployed on the blockchain, it cannot be modified. Therefore, having a bug-free smart contract is vital. To ensure a bug-free smart contract, it must be tested thoroughly. However, little is known about how developers test smart contracts in practice. Our study explores 139 open source smart contract projects that are written in Solidity to investigate the state of smart contract testing from three dimensions: (1) the developers working on the tests, (2) the used testing frameworks and testnets and (3) the type of tests that are conducted. We found that mostly core developers of a project are responsible for testing the contracts. Second, developers typically use only functional testing frameworks to test a smart contract, with Truffle being the most popular one. Finally, our results show that functional testing is conducted in most of the studied projects (93%), security testing is only performed in a few projects (9.4%) and traditional performance testing is conducted in none. In addition, we found 34 projects that mentioned or published external audit reports.",Canada,19 July 2022,0,23,https://doi.org/10.1145/3524481.3527228

However, Bitcoin's promise of anonymity is broken as recent work shows how Bitcoin's blockchain exposes users to reidentification and linking attacks. In consequence, different mixing services have emerged which promise to randomly mix a user's Bitcoins with other users' coins to provide anonymity based on the unlinkability of the mixing. However, proposed approaches suffer either from weak security guarantees and single points of failure, or small anonymity sets and missing deniability. In this paper, we propose CoinParty a novel, decentralized mixing service for Bitcoin based on a combination of decryption mixnets with threshold signatures. CoinParty is secure against malicious adversaries and the evaluation of our prototype shows that it scales easily to a large number of participants in real-world network settings. By the application of threshold signatures to Bitcoin mixing, CoinParty achieves anonymity by orders of magnitude higher than related work as we quantify by analyzing transactions in the actual Bitcoin blockchain and is first among related approaches to provide plausible deniability.",Germany,02 March 2015,71,958,https://doi.org/10.1145/2699026.2699100
